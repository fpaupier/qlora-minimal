Categories. The four categories of operations assessment\nemployed, illustrated in UK Figure 4A.1, are as follows.\na. Measurement of activity (MOA) is an assessment of task\nperformance and achievement of its associated purpose. It is\nan evaluation of what actions have been completed rather than\nsimply what has been undertaken – did we do, properly, the things\nwe planned to do? For example, in an attack on a command\nand control installation, MOA would be concerned with the level\nof physical destruction to command and control facilities, as\nopposed to the number of sorties flown. Although it may give an\napproximation of the outcome, MOA primarily provides an initial\ntest and adjust function. It informs decisions on whether activity\nshould be repeated or altered. The commander may draw on MOA\nto inform their decisions, but it is essentially tactical business. Battle\ndamage assessment is the most common form of MOA.\nb. Measures of performance (MOPs) are indicators used to\nassess friendly actions tied to measuring task accomplishment.16\nHow well are we achieving the task, rather than is the task creating\nthe desired effect. Both measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and\nMOPs are, therefore, focused on our own actions rather than the\nsubject.\nc. Measure of effectiveness is defined as: a criterion used\nto assess changes in system behaviour, capability or operating\nenvironment, tied to measuring the attainment of an end state,\nachievement of an objective, or creation of an effect.17 Drawing\non various forms of measurement and perspectives, yet avoiding\nunnecessary proliferation and complexity, it is used to monitor\n16 Allied Joint Publication-5, Allied Joint Doctrine for the Planning of Operations.

During Operation Telic 1, a daily\noperational review cycle was employed initially, while International Security\nAssistance Force (Afghanistan) IX reviewed the campaign every two months.\nUK 4A.3. Effect dimensions. NATO defines three effect dimensions where\nconsequences of military action should be considered: physical, virtual and\ncognitive. An effect could be created in several dimensions and MOEs should\nstrive to consider a range of relevant perspectives, while avoiding unnecessary\nproliferation of measures.

The physical effects of fires are comparatively\neasy to measure. The psychological effects of fires and information activities\nare, however, likely to be less self-evident, with causal relationships between\nactivity and effect far more difficult to establish. At the same time, the means\nof measurement may also be more subjective, drawing largely on perception,\ncomment and belief, all of which may be shaped by limited understanding,\nculture and a variety of pressures unrelated to the activity undertaken."

Applying these principles\nenables a common and coherent approach to complex and dynamic problems.\nThese principles are not absolute, but attract broad agreement as to their\nimportance and relevance. The situation or context may demand greater\nemphasis on some more than others. The principles of allied operations are as\nfollows.\na. Unity of effort. Unity of effort emphasizes the requirement to ensure\nall means are directed to a common goal. Achieving unity of effort is\noften complicated by the variety of international military and non-military\nactors involved, the lack of C2 arrangements between them, and varying\nviews of the objectives or end state. It might only be possible to achieve\nharmonization of effort which is characterized by goodwill, common\nplanning, clear and agreed division of responsibilities, an understanding\nof the capabilities and limitations of others, and respect for others'\nautonomy. In the absence of a formal multi-agency unifying mechanism,\nthe commander supported by the staff may be in a coordinating role,\nattempting to align divergent perspectives and priorities. To achieve\nunity of effort, it is essential to plan, communicate and coordinate at all\nlevels and with all actors involved in a comprehensive approach to crisis.\nIn some cases, NATO forces may operate in support of other IOs with\nwhich terms of reference or memoranda of understanding should be\nsigned stating the kind of support to be provided by NATO. Some IOs\nand NGOs may refuse to cooperate directly with military forces. This will\nrequire a flexible approach towards establishing processes or bodies to\nshare information between the involved IOs and NGOs and the NATO\nmilitary force based on the principles of CMI.13\n13 See AJP-01 Allied Joint Doctrine and MC 411/2 NATO Military Policy on Civil-Military\nCooperation and Civil-Military Interaction for detail."

Concentration of force. Combat power should be concentrated at\na time and place designed to generate superiority and achieve decisive\nresults. Superior force is not just a matter of numbers but also of fighting\nskills, cohesion, morale, timing, selecting objectives and exploiting\ntechnological advantage.\nc. Economy of effort. Because of limited resources, it may be\nnecessary to assume risks in some areas or to reduce ambition. The\nprinciple of economy of effort recognizes that, if concentrated strength\nis to be applied in the areas where it must create decisive effects,\ncompromise may be necessary in areas of lower priority. Thus economy\nof effort implies balancing available resources, given evaluated risk,\nagainst a commander's priorities.\nd. Freedom of action. Freedom of action empowers commanders to\npursue their designated missions and should minimize the restrictions\nplaced upon them. The operational level commander will attempt to\norchestrate operations, battles and engagements. To be successful, and\nto anticipate situations or exploit emerging opportunities, they must be\nempowered with the freedom of action to deploy reserves, set priorities\nand allocate maritime, land, air, space, special operations and support\nassets. However, the degree of freedom at the operational level will\ndepend upon the character of the conflict, the interaction of military and\nnon-military lines of operation within the overall collective strategy and\nthe decisions of NATO's, and contributing nations' strategic leadership.\nWhile recognizing these constraints, the commander must convey\na clear statement of intent, outlining their concept of operations and\nestablishing the objectives to be achieved by subordinate commanders\nto enable freedom of action at subordinate levels.\ne. Definition of objectives. Joint multinational operations must be\nfocused towards well defined and commonly understood objectives. A\nclear and concise end state allows planners to better identify objectives\nthat must be achieved to attain the end state. Joint planning integrates\nmilitary actions and capabilities with those of other instruments of\nnational power in time, space, and purpose. Objectives and their\nsupporting effects then provide the basis for identifying actions to\nconduct. Achieving operational objectives also ties execution of tactical\ntasks to attain the end state. There are four primary considerations for\nan objective:"
  },
  {
    "text": "AJP-3\n1-17\nEdition C Version 1 + UK national elements (Change 1)\n1\n- an objective establishes a single desired result or goal;\n- an objective should link directly to higher level objectives or to\nthe end state;\n- an objective is precise and unambiguous; and\n- an objective does not suggest ways or means and is not written\nas a task.\nf. Flexibility. Plans should be sufficiently flexible to respond to the\nunexpected and to empower commanders with maximum freedom of\naction. This requires: an understanding of the superior commanders'\nintent, flexibility of mind, rapid decision-making, effective organization\nand sufficient communications.\ng. Initiative. Initiative must be fostered through trust and mutual\nunderstanding and be developed through training. Initiative is about\nrecognizing and seizing opportunities and solving problems in an original\nmanner. For a climate of initiative to flourish, a commander should\nbe given the freedom to use initiative, and should in turn encourage\nsubordinates to do likewise. This requires a training and operations\nculture that promotes an attitude of calculated risk-taking to win rather\nthan simply to prevent defeat. Command authorities delegated to the\nlowest practical level should encourage individuals under their command\nto use their initiative.\nh. Offensive spirit. The core of this principle is the notion of a\nproactive mindset. This fosters confidence, encourages enterprise and\na determination not to cede the initiative, and promotes a culture of\nsuccess and achievement. As a state of mind and in practical terms,\noffensive action is often decisive, but its broader application should\nnot preclude defensive action when circumstances and prudence\ndemand. An offensive spirit implies a vigorous, incisive approach\nto defeat opponents, to exploit opportunities and to apply constant\npressure against other forms of resistance and sources of instability.\nOffensive action is the practical way in which a commander seeks to\ngain advantage, sustain momentum and seize the initiative. An offensive\nspirit delivers the benefits inferred by action rather than reaction, and the\nfreedom to force a decision."

Surprise is the consequence\nof confusion induced by deliberately or incidentally introducing the\nunexpected. Surprise is temporary and successful surprise will require\nexploiting to prevent an adversary's recovery. Surprise is built on speed,\nsecrecy and deception. If successful, surprise may achieve results\ndisproportionate to the effort expended.\nj. Security. Security enhances freedom of action by limiting vulnerability\nto hostile activities and threats. Active and passive security measures\nhelp to deny critical information to an adversary. They assist deception\nand help counter offensive actions.\nk. Simplicity. Simple plans and clear, concise orders minimize\nmisunderstanding and confusion. Simple plans are less vulnerable to\nfriction than complex plans and are more easily remembered under\npressure. The more complex the plan, the more there is to go wrong,\nbut simplicity is not an excuse for plans that lack the co-ordinating\ndetail necessary to make them work. Clear direction and a thorough\nunderstanding of the commander's intent simplify planning and conduct\nof operations.\nl. Maintenance of morale. Commanders should give their command\nan identity, promote self-esteem, inspire it with a sense of common\npurpose and unity of effort, and give it achievable aims. High\nmorale depends on good leadership, which instils courage, energy,\ndetermination, respect and unity amongst those under command.\nUK principles of war versus operational principles\nUK 1.9. The UK's principles of war are equivalent to, and closely\naligned with, the NATO principles of operations. Nevertheless, there are\nsome variances due to different emphases; for example, the UK includes\nsustainability as a principle whilst NATO does not. In addition, to reflect\nthe rapidly changing character of warfare, UK has also evolved two\nprinciples: concentration of effects replaces concentration of force; and\nintegration replaces cooperation.

    "text": "AJP-3\n1-19\nEdition C Version 1 + UK national elements (Change 1)\n1\nOperational considerations\n1.22 The principles outlined above are, in turn, supported by the following\noperational considerations. The operational considerations are always relevant;\nhowever, their relative importance will depend on the operations theme.\na. Credibility. A NATO-led force must be credible. A key factor in\nestablishing credibility is to ensure that at all levels words match deeds\nand that any force deployed is perceived as professional and capable of\naccomplishing its mission. Establishing credibility is essential for building\nconfidence and is accomplished through the coordination of information\nactivities through information operations (Info Ops) in accordance with\nextant strategic communications (StratCom) direction and guidance\n(usually in the form of a StatCom Framework). This may be assisted\nby deploying forces with sufficient capability to deter hostile actions\nor by judiciously applying force. When force (or the perceived threat of\nforce) is used, it will be necessary to have an estimate of the impact that\nthose actions may have, not just on credibility, but also on the operation\nas a whole through the associated political, economic, social and\nenvironmental implications.\nb. Consent. Promoting consent and cooperation from the HN is a\nprerequisite for many operations. Before execution, any military force\nactivity that may result in a loss of consent should be carefully balanced\nUnity of effort emphasises the requirement to ensure all means\nare directed to a common goal"

Consent and\ncooperation can promote perceived legitimacy14 if it can be shown to\nthe parties that their status and ultimate authority will increase if they\nsuccessfully resolve their own disputes. When the people and parties\nare made stakeholders in the process, then their motivation to cooperate\nis greatly increased. At the tactical level, this possibility can be pursued\nby creating incentive-based opportunities to cooperate in jointly carrying\nout certain tasks.\nc. Mutual respect and understanding. The respect in which the\nNATO-led force is held will be a direct consequence of its professional\nconduct and how it treats the local population and recognized\nauthorities. Through a United Nations (UN) mandate, Status of Forces\nAgreement (SOFA), or other special agreements, the NATO-led force\nmay enjoy certain immunities related to its duties. Notwithstanding\nthis, its members must respect the laws and customs of the HN and\nmust be seen to be doing so. The commander should also ensure the\nsame principles are recognized and implemented among the different\nnational, cultural and ethnic elements within the formations which make\nup the force. All personnel must consistently demonstrate the highest\nstandards of discipline exercised through controlled and professional\nbehaviour on and off duty15. This also contributes to maintaining\nperceived legitimacy.\nd. Transparency. The mission and concept of operations, as well as\nthe end state, must be readily understood by all actors and obvious to\nall parties and agencies. Achieving a common understanding will help to\nreduce suspicion and mistrust and enhance operational effectiveness.\nInformation should be gathered and shared wherever possible. While\ntransparency of operations, including media access, should be the\ngeneral rule, it must be balanced against the need to ensure the security\nof the mission and of the operation.\ne. Freedom of movement. Freedom of movement is essential for any\noperation. The mandate, SOFA and rules of engagement (ROE) must\nallow NATO forces to remain free at all times to perform their duties\nwithout interference from local groups and organizations. Experience\nindicates that various factions will often try to impose local restrictions\non freedom of movement. These restrictions must be firmly and swiftly\n14 See AJP-01 Allied Joint Doctrine for details.\n15 See Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council document EAPC(C)D(2014)0019 for detail."

Strategic communications16. All aspects of NATO activities have\ninformation and communications components and implications.\nTherefore, it is important NATO's communication-related effects and its\nnarrative are integral to the OPLAN. They are to be considered in the\nplanning process, reflected in the operations design, expressed in the\ncommander's intent and applied during execution and the targeting\nprocess. StratCom is the integration of communication capabilities and\ninformation staff functions with other military activities in order to shape\nthe Information Environment, in support of NATO aims and objectives.\nStratCom principles have particular importance to the communication\ncapabilities of Military Public Affair (Mil PA) and psychological operations\n(PsyOp) and the staff function of information operations (Info Ops) and\nrequires a network-centric collaborative approach to support rapid\ndecision making, efficiency and unity of effort. As such, operational\ncommunication capabilities and staff functions should be synchronized.\nThough synchronized, each communication staff function still retains\ntheir functional responsibilities and Mil PA will retain a direct advisory role\nand direct access to the commander.\ng. Cyberspace Operations. Many aspects of joint operations rely\non cyberspace, which reaches across geographic and geopolitical\nboundaries, much of which reside outside of NATO control. Cyberspace\nis also integrated with the operation of critical infrastructures, as well\nas the conduct of commerce, governance, and national security.\n16 See MC 0628 NATO Military Policy on Strategic Communications for detail.\nStrategic communication\nUK 1.10. The UK uses the term strategic communication rather than\ncommunications.

Commanders\nconduct cyber operations to retain freedom of maneuver in cyberspace,\ndeny freedom of action to adversaries, and enable other operational\nactivities. Cyber operations rely on links and nodes that reside in the\nphysical domains, and perform functions in cyberspace and the physical\ndomains. Similarly, activities in the physical domains can create effects in\nand through cyberspace by affecting the electro-magnetic spectrum or\nthe physical infrastructure. Cyberspace operations will be conducted by\nindividual Nations in response to formal requirements and in accordance\nwith their respective national laws, and cyber capabilities and information\nwill be provided to NATO by these Nations in accordance with their\nrespective national policies and guidelines.\nh. Environmental protection. Effective environmental protection\nenhances force health protection, supports operations by building\npositive relationships with the HN. In order to achieve the environmental\nprotection objective, optimization of the use of energy should be applied\nto all phases of NATO-led military activities while meeting operational\nrequirements.

Addressing these considerations, in a coherent manner,\ncontributes toward more sustainable security outcomes and supports\nmission success. An approach that seeks to address these considerations\nwithin the constraints of the operation requires the military to better\nunderstand how these human security factors affect individuals,\ncommunities and other actors. This understanding allows the military to plan\noperations that minimise harm to civilians, reduce human rights violations\nand achieve conflict sensitive outcomes.

The operational\nlevel links strategic objectives to tactical level operations. At the operational\nlevel and within a designated joint operations area (JOA), armed forces are\ndeployed and employed in accordance with a strategy to achieve\nmilitary-strategic objectives. Without this link, it is unlikely that tactical actions\nwill lead to attaining the desired end state. Therefore, the commander decides\non how tactical activity is generated to achieve those strategic objectives.\nThis is described as \"operational art' and is defined as the employment of\nforces to achieve strategic and/or operational objectives through the design,\norganization, integration and conduct of strategies, campaigns, major\noperations and battles.\n1.2 At the operational level, emphasis should be placed on integrating the\ncontributing nations' forces and the synergy that can be attained; the\nsuccess of the process will determine the ability of a joint force to achieve its\nobjectives. Planning for complex operations1 also requires cooperation with\nother non-military actors.

Sea control may also include\nnaval cooperation and guidance of shipping, protection of the sea lines\nof communication, blockades or embargoes against economic or military\nshipping and maritime interdiction operations. This includes operations to\nlocate, classify and track surface vessels, submarines and aircraft and, if\nrequired, applying force against them. Amphibious operations with their\ninherent flexibility increase the commander's options for manoeuvre.\n1.29 Maritime forces directly participate in operations ashore through the\nprojection of power, by executing strike warfare, amphibious operations and\nriverine operations. They can enable or support missions ashore by influencing\nland operations through deterrence, naval fire support, sea basing of land, air\nand SOF assets, moving land forces via sealift and/or providing access. They\nalso can be employed in littoral waters for the conduct of sea control or denial,\nand function as joint force or component command and control platforms.\n1.30 Land component contribution to joint operations21. The nature of land\noperations reflects the diversities and complexities of the environment. The\nnumber and variety of participants, combatants, non-combatants, IOs, NGOs,\nobservers (e.g. the media) and other interested parties, factions and agencies,\nwith the potential for error, confusion and friction, may be greater in land\noperations than in other operations. This complexity requires an approach that\nemphasizes decentralized command, freedom of action, tempo and initiative,\nto contend with the multitude of activities and rapidly changing situations.\n1.31 Land forces' roles normally entail seizing and holding terrain,\nneutralizing enemy forces and regaining lost territory. They are able to conduct\nsimultaneously various types of operations, utilizing fires and manoeuvre\nto apply overwhelming combat power, achieve decisive results, protect the\nforce, and facilitate future operations. A wide variety of missions may be\nexecuted, ranging from security tasks in support of stabilization activities and\nreconstruction efforts to combat operations often in close proximity to each\nother and the population. Land forces require substantial materiel, which\nnormally requires sealift, airlift and ground transportation.

Often land forces will be\nsupported by other components.\n1.32 Air component contribution to joint operations22. The four broad,\nfundamental and enduring operational roles of air power are counter-air, attack,\nair mobility, and contribution to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.\nControl of the air shapes the joint operations area wherein friendly operations\ncan proceed at the optimum place and time without prohibitive air interference.\nGaining control of the air is not an end in itself, but is often a prerequisite for\nconducting land and maritime operations. Once sufficient control of the air\nhas been achieved, air power provides the possibilities to project military\npower, less limited by terrain. Air power's reach and concentration of force\nallow it to be employed at all levels of operations. The speed, reach, ubiquity\nand flexibility of air power offers opportunities for wresting the initiative and\nsupporting other forces.\n1.33 Persistent air operations normally require the availability of secure\nairbases sufficiently close to the JOA, over-flight rights, flexible use of airspace\nand the necessary support. Naval aviation may reduce some or all of the\nrequirements for secure airbases ashore and over-flight rights. For operations\nin regions with no or very limited HNS, extensive military engineering measures\nmay be required to provide the necessary facilities. Air assets are often scarce;\nmoreover, they are vulnerable from air attack when on the ground. Prosecuting\neffective air operations of all types depends on a wide range of supporting\nfunctions.\n22 See AJP-3.3 Allied Joint Doctrine for Air and Space Operations for detail.\nUK air power roles\nUK 1.22. The UK recognises the same four fundamental air power roles\nas NATO but considers control of the air as the correct term instead of\ncounter air; the latter being reserved for the specific operations, taken by\nany component, to gain and maintain the required degree of control of the\nair. In addition, the UK refers to the 'contribution to intelligence, surveillance\nand reconnaissance' air power role as simply 'intelligence, surveillance and\nreconnaissance'. The UK also recognises the importance of air command\nand control as the key enabler without which all four fundamental air power\nroles cannot be delivered effectively.

While component logistics are focused\nforward, the JFLogC not only looks forward providing logistic support\nto them but also looks backward to monitor the logistic activities of the\nstrategic base. A JFLogC is likely to be deployed when the scale or\ncomplexity of the operation exceeds the capacity of a JTF headquarters J1/\nJ4 staff.

It delivers a coordination and liaison function between the UK,\nother coalition forces and the joint commander. A JFLogC may adopt the\nrole of national support element; however, the complexity of multinational\nlogistic coordination may demand a separate national support element. A\nnational support element is responsible for coordinating national operational\nlogistic activity across the force. National support elements, therefore, have\na wider involvement in component logistics than a JFLogC, representing\nnational requirements at all levels to the joint commander.

These\ncapabilities are applied across the joint functions and independently. For\nmore detail see Annex B Related capabilities to the joint functions. In any joint\noperation, the commander may choose from a wide variety of joint and service\ncapabilities and combine them in various ways to perform joint functions\nand accomplish the mission. The operation plan/order describes the way\nforces and assets are used together to perform joint functions and activities.\nHowever, forces and assets are not characterized by the functions for which\nthe commander is employing them. A single force or asset can perform\nmultiple functions simultaneously or sequentially while executing a single task.\n1.43 Manoeuvre. The principal purpose of manoeuvre is to gain positional\nadvantage in respect to the adversary from which force can be threatened\nor applied. Manoeuvre seeks to render adversaries incapable of resisting\neffectively throughout all dimensions of the JOA effectively by shattering their\ncohesion rather than destroying each of his components through incremental\nattrition. Manoeuvre involves the assets of more than one component and may\neven involve strategic assets, temporarily made available for the operation. At\nthe operational level manoeuvre is the means by which a commander sets\nthe terms in time and space, declines or joins combat or exploits emerging\ndevelopments. It is the process by which combat power is focused where\nit can have decisive effect, to pre-empt, dislocate, or disrupt adversary\noperations. It involves trade-offs (e.g., speed versus time, width versus depth,\nconcentration versus dispersion), and thus requires an acceptance of risk.\n1.44 Fires. Fires creates effects on a target25. They may be applied directly\nor indirectly to create a wide range of physical and psychological effects by\ndegrading capability and shattering cohesion. Fires are often delivered by\njoint assets and may include naval fire, land direct fire, land indirect fire and\naerial fire. Using fires is central to the commander's plan; fires provide the\ncommander with the ability to affect the physical component of adversary\nfighting power, impacting their understanding and moral component and,\nconsequently, influencing their will to fight. Fires may be used in isolation, but\nit is preferable to integrate them with manoeuvre to achieve optimal results.

Having\ndecided on the strategic ends and the role of the military force in achieving\nthem, the means are allocated and the ways that are to be used are decided.\nConsequently, when designing a joint operation for the military force,\ncommanders and their staff assign resources, i.e. plan and decide in general\nterms which resources do what. The commander does this by assigning\nmissions and objectives to the subordinate components, and then allocating\nmeans, in terms of capabilities, to achieve them. These capabilities conduct\njoint action to create effects and achieve objectives. Joint action focuses\non affecting adversaries through the combined application of the following\njoint functions: manoeuvre; fires; information; and CIMIC. These activities are\nunderpinned by the joint functions C2 and intelligence (including surveillance\nand reconnaissance). Freedom of action to execute joint action is further\nsupported by the joint functions sustainment and force protection.\n1.62 The commander directs and orchestrates the tactical activities of the\ncomponents; refocusing effort when necessary to achieve synergy between\nthem. While tactical commanders possess the means to conduct military\nactivities at their level, their capabilities are most effective when integrated\nand synchronized across the joint force. Once execution is underway, the\ncommander needs to maintain a clear perspective of the underlying purpose\nof activities and the desired effects to create. This, in turn, will allow them to\nrespond rapidly and effectively to events.\n1.63 Joint action. The conceptual framework that permits this force\nintegration and synchronization is called joint action. Joint action is described\nas the deliberate use and orchestration of military capabilities and activities to\naffect an actor's understanding, capability and will, and the cohesion between\nthem.\na. Understanding. An adversary's understanding underpins their\ndecision-making; however, it is not absolute and does not endure.\nTheir understanding of the situation – the competing narratives, relative\nstrengths, effectiveness and vulnerabilities – affects perception and,\ntherefore, their will to act.\nb. Capability. Capability depends on a physical capacity for action\nand applying it effectively and in context. While there is often an"

Will. The will to act or resist at the operational and tactical level is\nbased on the unity of communities of interest or armed groups, fighting\nspirit, morale and cohesion. Will can be affected physically (through\nactivities like fires) and psychologically (through perception or surprise).\nOnce the will to act is lost, an adversary relinquishes the ability to affect\nevents.\nd. Cohesion. Cohesion is fundamental to any group's ability to fight\nand resist effectively. It combines understanding, capability and will to\ngenerate the strength to act in unison through motivation, allegiance\nand resolve.\nIntegrated action\nUK 1.28. The UK uses the tenet of integrated action to describe the\nintegration required for the successful orchestration of operations.\nIntegrated action reflects the UK's ambition to harness all the levers of\npower available and to integrate them in such a manner that it can change\naudience behaviour to achieve its strategic objectives.\nUK 1.29. Integrated action can be described as the audience-centric\norchestration of military activities, across all operational domains,\nsynchronised with non-military activities to influence the attitude and\nbehaviour of selected audiences necessary to achieve successful\noutcomes. Successful integrated action begins with commanders being\nclear about the outcome they seek; they need to study the audiences\nrelevant to achieving the identified outcome and analyse the effects they\nwish to create on those target audiences. Only then should the mix of\ncapabilities be determined to create physical, cognitive and virtual effects\nacross the operational domains to affect the understanding, physical\ncapability, will and cohesion of the audiences to achieve a successful\noutcome. These lethal and non-lethal capabilities may belong to the force\nitself, or intergovernmental, inter-agency, non-governmental, private sector\nor multinational actors involved in the operation.

Understanding the audiences is\nthe major consideration of integrated action.\nUK 1.30. An audience-centric approach recognises that people are at\nthe heart of competition; it is their decisions and behaviours that determine\nhow competition is conducted and resolved. Audiences are segmented into\nthree general categories – public, stakeholders and actors – depending on\ntheir ability to affect our outcomes. A sophisticated understanding provides\nthe focus for planning and executing activity to create or maintain the\nattitudes that constitute behaviour. Commanders, with an understanding of\nthe higher commander's intent and the strategic narrative, can then conduct\ntarget audience analysis to identify the effects that they wish to create.\nUK 1.31. The successful application of integrated action depends on\nseveral factors. These are described below.\na. Information advantage. Information advantage recognises that\nconnectivity and data underpin economic and military power in the\nInformation Age: the side that gains the upper hand in the information\nbattle is likely to possess a significant advantage. Information\nadvantage is critical to integrated action by: using information as an\nenabler improves understanding, decision-making, execution and\nassessment; denying information to the UK's adversaries and ensuring\nsystems are resilient protects any position of advantage achieved.\nMoreover, information advantage is essential to effective integration\nbetween Defence, its allies and partners. Without high quality, timely\ninformation to assist in understanding audiences it will be impossible\nto identify fleeting opportunities across all the operational domains.\nFinally, Defence can no longer just attempt to affect the enemy's\nmilitary in isolation. Every action produces a communicative effect,\nand in the information environment that effect in the engagement\nspace is global to multiple audiences.\nb. Audience analysis. Persistently analysing and seeking to\nunderstand those audiences relevant to the overall objective, be they\nglobal, national or within a theatre of operations, underpins integrated\naction. Achieving this understanding is a challenge; totally predictable\nrelationships between cause and effect are rare in adversarial human\nconflict. Successful audience analysis will identify opportunities to\nchange attitudes or behaviours. To do this will require the sharing and\ncollation of data, information, intelligence and specialist skills. These"

This activity is enabled through trust, interoperable systems,\neffective security and within appropriate legal frameworks.\nc. Legitimacy and lawfare. Integrated action requires commanders\nat all levels to operate where the legal and ethical frameworks in which\nour capabilities are employed may be novel, unclear and contested.\nWhere the UK's rhetoric and action are misaligned, its adversaries\nwill seek to undermine its legitimacy. These adversaries will seek to\nuse the law to restrict the UK's freedom of manoeuvre. Integrated\naction requires Defence to be able to explain and justify its behaviours\nto domestic and international audiences, and to argue persuasively\nfor the political and policy permissions to create the desired effects.\nDefence must be able to respond immediately to false narratives with\ntruth backed up by evidence. Equally, the UK must be able to expose\nits adversaries illegal and immoral actions, as well as being robust\nin exhorting its key values in the debates around its capabilities and\nactions.\nd. Capability and activity integration. Integrated action orchestrates\nmilitary capabilities and activities, and synchronises with non-military\n(including those of belonging to or generated by partners across\ngovernment and the civilian sector) to create lethal and non-lethal\neffects. Experience has shown that this integration will not be easy;\nthe commander will be trying to integrate capabilities that they may\nnot control and cohere activity taking place both within and beyond\ntheir area of operations. As such commanders will need to align where\npossible their objectives with those of partners. Achieving this may\nwell require compromise, as consensus (on matters such as objectives\nand burden sharing) will be necessary to proceed as a willing coalition\nor partnership, irrespective of the level of operation. At the national\nstrategic level there are mechanisms to align departmental objectives\nand resources (such as the NSSIGs), but at the operational and\ntactical levels how this occurs may be less structured. Sophisticated\ncapability and activity integration across the operational domains and\nlevels of operations will place different and often significant demands\non commanders and staff to integrate ever more capabilities and\nactivities."

CT may be conducted against\nstate-sponsored or transnational, autonomous armed groups\nwho are not easily identified, and who may not fall under the\ncategories of combatants defined in the applicable international\nlaw. NATO forces engaged in a CT operation may be required\nto operate in conflict areas with or without the assistance of the\nlocal government.

Peace support can include conflict prevention, peacemaking,\npeace enforcement, peacekeeping and peacebuilding.\n(1) Peace support may take place in the context of both inter-state\nand intra-state conflict. This places additional responsibilities on\ncertain types of military deployments in peace support because\nsecurity activity cannot be considered in isolation and military, police,\nand civilian actors will be required to work together to address the\ncauses of conflict in an attempt to secure a sustainable peace.\n(2) Impartially implementing a political strategy aimed at upholding\nthe purposes and principles set out in the UN Charter is the\nfundamental difference separating peace support from other types\nof crisis response operations.\n32 See AJP-3.4.1 Allied Joint Doctrine for Military Contribution to Peace Support for\ndetail."

HA may occur in response to both natural and\nmanmade disasters including as a consequence of conflict or the flight\nfrom political, religious, or ethnic persecution. HA is limited in scope\nand duration and is designed to supplement or complement the efforts\nof the HN civil authorities, IOs, NGOs, and other non-military actors\nthat may have the primary responsibility for providing that assistance.\nThe different types of military support to HA are disaster relief, support\nto dislocated civilians, technical assistance and support, CBRN\nconsequence management, and security.\n(1) In many cases, the main support from the military will be to\nprovide a secure environment to allow humanitarian actors to\noperate.

Tasks that\nmilitary forces may be requested to perform in support of HA are\ncategorized as: Infrastructure support, indirect assistance and direct\nassistance. NATO military activities may support short-term tasks\nsuch as communications restoration, relief supply management, port\noperations, base operating support, search and rescue, providing\nemergency medical care, humanitarian demining assistance, and\nhigh priority relief supply delivery, all within means and capabilities.\nThey could also take the form of advice and selected training,\nassessments, and providing manpower and equipment.\nd. Military contribution to stabilization and reconstruction35. \nStabilization and reconstruction (S&R) is normally a civilian-led process\nthat commonly takes place during or after crisis in states that have\nlost the capacity to govern themselves effectively. As such it is best\nundertaken by those actors and organizations that have the relevant\nexpertise, mandate, and competences required. Consequently, the\ninitial military contribution will generally be focused on providing a safe\nand secure environment so that reconstruction efforts can occur. While\nmany aspects of S&R are intended to be undertaken by non-military\nactors and organizations, there may be situations where the military is\nobliged to assume temporary responsibility for areas of S&R36. As part of\nthis military effort the availability of units capable of performing stability\npolicing tasks can contribute to the success of the mission by deploying\nspecialized policing skills assets and specialists aimed at controlling and\nsecuring environs where reconstruction is taking place. S&R activities\ninclude support to establishing long-term stability and strengthened\ngovernance, local capacity building, re-establishment of the rule of law.\nS&R also contributes to establishing the basis for economic, human,\nhealth and social development. The long-term goal is to promote those\nprocesses which lead to lasting stability and self-sustaining peace.\n35 See AJP-3.4.5 Allied Joint Doctrine for the Military Contribution to Stabilization and\nReconstruction for detail.\n36 See AJP-3.22 Allied Joint Doctrine for Stability Policing and AJP-3.21 Allied Joint\nDoctrine for Military Police for detail."

Military contribution to non-combatant evacuations37. \nNon-combatant evacuation operations (NEOs) are national diplomatic\ninitiatives, with Alliance forces participating in a supporting role. NEOs\nare conducted to relocate non-combatants threatened in a foreign\ncountry to a place of safety. Normally, Alliance forces would only support\na NEO in the framework of a NATO-led operation and that support\nwould not include the evacuation of nationals, which remains a national\nresponsibility. However, nations could conduct NEOs for their nationals\non a bi-national or multinational basis using NATO doctrine. Generally, a\nforce committed to a NEO should have the capability to provide security,\nreception and control, movement, and emergency medical support38 for\nthe civilians and unarmed military personnel to be evacuated.\nf. Extraction. Extraction operations may be described as missions\nwhere a NATO-led force conducts or assists in the withdrawal of\nmilitary missions and units from a crisis region. A force committed to an\nextraction operation should have the necessary assets for transporting\nthe personnel to be extracted. An extraction operation is most likely\nto be conducted in an uncertain or hostile environment. In a hostile\nenvironment, a loss of consent could occur or the HN government\nmay not have effective control of the territory in question. Under these\ncircumstances, planning must anticipate a potential need for a NATO\nextraction force. In the past, NATO has established extraction forces, on\na temporary basis, to enhance the safety of international missions.\ng. Military contribution to sanctions. In broad terms, the enforcement\nof sanctions is designed to force a nation to abide by international law or\nto conform to a resolution or mandate. Sanctions generally concern the\ndenial of supplies, diplomatic, economic, and other trading privileges,\nand the freedom of movement of those living in the sanctions area.\nSanctions may be imposed against a specific party or over a wide\narea embracing all parties. These operations apply coercion through\ninterdiction of movement of certain types of designated items into or out\nof a nation or specified area. These operations are military in nature and\nserve both political and military purposes. The political objective is to\ncompel a country or group to conform to the objectives of the initiating\nbody. The military objective is to establish a barrier, allowing only\n37 See AJP-3.4.2 Allied Joint Doctrine for Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations\nfor detail.\n38 May include the need to provide adequate medical support for children, pregnant\nmothers and the elderly.

Depending on geography,\nsanction enforcement normally involves some combination of air,\nland, maritime, and SOF assets. Examples are embargoes, and the\nenforcement of exclusion zones and no-fly zones (NFZs).\n(1) Embargoes. An embargo means a prohibition or restriction on\nthe entry or exit of goods, persons, and services into and/or from\nstates through sea or airports or across land. Today, the term is\ngenerally associated with sanctions that prohibit the movement of\nspecific cargoes in and out of a territory. Enforcement of embargoes\nnormally involves maritime interdiction operations. They may also\ninclude embargoes against economic or military shipping. In addition\nto air and maritime assets, land assets and SOF have specialized\ncapabilities that may be employed in support of embargoes.\nEmbargoes have several distinct advantages over other compelling\nmeasures involving hostile actions and are conducted to resolve\ndisputes through measures short of armed conflict, while allowing\nlimited and controlled force to be used, if necessary. If tensions rise,\nthe affected nation's military ability can be diminished by an effective\nembargo on military supplies. The effectiveness of any embargo\nmay occur in the medium- to long-term. Intelligence and particularly\neconomic and civilian indicators may be needed to plan and assess\nthe effectiveness and impacts of any embargo. Additionally, precise\nROE should be established to minimize an unwanted escalation of\nthe crisis resulting from attempts to break the embargo.\n(2) Exclusion zones. An exclusion zone is established to prohibit\nspecified activities. Exclusion zones can be established in the air, at\nsea, or on land. The measures are usually imposed by the UN, or\nother international bodies due to breaches of international standards\nof human rights or flagrant abuse of international law regarding the\nconduct of states. The sanctions may create economic, political,\nmilitary, or other conditions where the intent is to change the\nbehaviour of the offending nation.\n(3) No-fly zones. A NFZ is a special type of exclusion zone.\nA NFZ is airspace of specific dimensions set aside for specific\npurpose in which no aircraft operations are permitted, except as\nauthorized by the appropriate commander and controlling agency.\nIt can be established above a party's territory or in a neighbouring\ncountry.

ROE must be clearly articulated to effectively support\nexecution of these operations.\nh. Military contribution to freedom of navigation and\noverflight. These operations are conducted to demonstrate international\nrights to navigate sea or air routes. Freedom of navigation is a sovereign\nright accorded by international law. Common law has long recognized\nthat a coastal nation may exercise jurisdiction and control within its\nterritorial sea. These rights have been implemented in the UN convention\non the Law of the Sea. This convention accords the right of “innocent\npassage” to ships of other nations through a nation's territorial waters.\nPassage is “innocent” as long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good\norder, or security of the coastal state. International waters are free for\nreasonable use by all nations. The international civil aviation organization\ndevelops the norms that regulate the national and international use of\nairspace. Freedom of navigation by aircraft through international airspace\nis a well-established principle of international law. Aircraft threatened\nby nations or groups through the extension of airspace control zones\noutside the established international norms will result in legal measures\nto rectify the situation.39\n39 See MC 0372/2 NATO Military Policy for Non-Article 5 Crisis Response Operations for\ndetail.\nUK 1.32. Whilst NATO only refers to two types of operation (combat\nand crisis response), Defence Strategy 2022 lists five types of operation\nto be undertaken by UK Defence: homeland, global foundation, persistent\nengagement, crisis response and warfighting.

A permanent global foundation will integrate\nan enlarged Defence network (of British Defence Staffs, Defence\nattachés, liaison officers and our overt and covert counterterrorism\nnetworks), the Defence Intelligence enterprise and overseas bases to\nprovide strategic access, reach, insight and influence to enable the\nforce to be persistently engaged across the globe and respond to\nemerging crisis. The maintenance of a functional global foundation\nis a permanent task and is required to deliver critical outputs which\ninclude the defence of the UK and its Overseas Territories as well as\nour ability to reaggregate for crisis response and warfighting.\nc. Persistent engagement. Enabled by the global foundation,\npersistent engagement will provide deterrence and reassurance\nfor allies and partners and allow Defence to compete with our\nadversaries by using proactive forward presence deployments\nincluding overseas exercises, counterterrorism, counter-state threats\nand partner capacity building activities. Persistent engagement\nis a more productive use of the force, employed more frequently\noverseas in support of non-warfighting operations, while maintaining\nthe ability to rapidly respond to crisis or transition to warfighting.\nd. Crisis response. Persistent engagement may, over time,\nenhance Defence's ability to pre-empt and manage crisis before they\nescalate. Should this fail and crises escalate, Defence will still need\nto be able to reconfigure the force to respond where the UK interests\nare threatened.\ne. Warfighting. Warfighting is an all operational domain, large-scale\nactivity conducted to defend NATO and UK territory, following the\ndeclaration of Article 5. It is a contest between the regular armed\nforces of states, including irregular elements."

Command authority is allocated formally to a commander through\norders and directives. To command is to exercise that authority by motivating\nand directing people and organizations. Exercising command requires\nleadership and decision-making. To make decisions, commanders combine\npersonal experience, training and study with operational situational awareness,\nunderstanding and staff advice. Commanders will determine whether a\ndecision is required, what the decision is to be, and when the decision is to be\nmade and enacted. They will then use their command authority and personal\nleadership to ensure decisions are understood and executed, enabled and\nsupported by control measures.\n1.68 Control. To control is to manage and direct forces and functions\nconsistent with a commander's command authority. Control of forces and\nfunctions helps commanders and staffs:\n- calculate, acquire and apply resources to support the mission;\n- develop specific instructions from general guidance;\n- integrate and synchronize actions throughout the JOA;\n- provide resources to maintain freedom of action, delegate authority\nand direct operations from any location;\n- determine the status of organizational effectiveness;\n- identify variance and correct deviation from set standards; and\n- provide a means to measure, report, and correct performance."

The UK has two further tenets of doctrine that complement\nintegrated action. Together these principles underpin the UK's conduct of\njoint, inter-agency and multinational command.\nUK 1.34. The manoeuvrist approach is Defence's fighting doctrine. It\nis an attitude of mind that seeks an indirect solution – pitching strength\nagainst vulnerabilities – stressing the use of initiative to act in original\nways, with a relentless determination to retain the initiative and exploit\nsuccess. It depends on practical knowledge, agility, mission command and\nthe willingness to accept risks. As a broad philosophy, the manoeuvrist\napproach is about \"manoeuvring the mind' and has widespread utility\nbeyond warfighting. The manoeuvrist approach requires an understanding\nof the opponent's vulnerabilities and how these might be exploited, as well\nas self-awareness of our own weaknesses.\nUK 1.35.

It requires a single commander with the\nrequisite authority to direct all forces in pursuit of the agreed objectives or end\nstate. At the military strategic, operational and tactical levels of command, a\nfundamental tenet of C2 is unity of command, which provides the necessary\ncohesion for the planning and execution of operations; this is a significant\npart of a principle of operations – unity of effort. Command relationships, by\nwhich commanders achieve this authority, will be determined when a JTF is\nestablished. These relationships will acknowledge the constraints that are\nplaced on the use of national force contributions and supporting national\nassets and the extent of military activities of other authorities in a designated\nJOA. As a minimum, a commander would normally have operational control\nover all NATO or attached forces within a JOA. When unity of command (for\nforces or agencies outside the JTF) is not wholly achievable, unity of effort\nshould be established using clear coordination arrangements.\n1.70 Continuity of command. Command should be continuous throughout an\noperation. During an operation further enhancing unity of command is desirable\nthrough continuity of command. In principle, \"the commander who plans should\nexecute'; however, circumstances may not permit this. The higher command\nauthority, in consultation with the operational level commander, should arrange\na succession of command; an operational level commander should in turn\narrange an alternate headquarters to meet operations contingencies.\n1.71 Chain of command. The C2 structure is hierarchical and should be\ndefined and understood by all levels of command, to ensure a complete\nunderstanding of command responsibilities throughout the C2 system. A clear\nchain of command strengthens integration between components. Where\nnecessary and appropriate, direction and orders to a subordinate commander\nmay include tasks for specific force elements, subject to any limitations\nimposed by nations. Irreconcilable differences may need to be referred up the\nchain of command for resolution at the strategic level.\n1.72 Integration of command. The command structure should ensure\nthat the capabilities of the nations, or those of several nations, are directed\ndecisively to achieve the operational objectives in the most effective way.\nComponent commands, to which national contingents contribute, are normally\nenvironmental or functional, but the specific task organization will reflect\nthe higher commander's specific operations requirements.

As a contributing nation to a multinational force, the UK may\nembed a national contingent commander within the JTF headquarters or\nmay deploy a headquarters as a national contingent headquarters.

They should then apply their judgment, influenced\nby results of consultation upwards and laterally. Several methods can assist:\na. Risk management. Commanders should identify, assess and\nmanage the risks involved in their military operations, and provide\nguidance to the staff and subordinates for risk reduction, mitigation and\nexploitation.

Operational control (OPCON) is the authority delegated to a\ncommander to direct forces assigned so that the commander may\naccomplish specific missions or tasks, which are usually limited by\nfunction, time, or location and to deploy units concerned, and to retain\nor assign tactical control of those units. It does not include authority to\nassign separate employment of components of the units concerned.\nNeither does it, of itself, include administrative or logistic control. For\nforces allocated under OPCON the gaining commander may not break\nup the organizational integrity of the force for separate employment.\nUnder OPCON forces assigned may only be employed within certain\nconstraints such as function, time or location imposed by the higher\nauthority. For example, the forces may only be assigned for a single\nphase of a particular operation. This may be done for national purposes\nin the case of a multinational context, where it is in a participating\nnation's interest to constrain in some fashion the employment of the\ncontributed force. Under OPCON the gaining commander may assign a\nmission to the assigned element that is distinct from, but related to, the\ngaining commander's overall mission.\nd. Tactical command (TACOM) is the authority delegated to a\ncommander to assign tasks to forces under his command for the\naccomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority. Under\nTACOM the gaining commander may only allocate to the assigned\nforce a specific task consistent for the accomplishment of the mission\nand purpose assigned by the higher commander, that is, within the\nparameters of the current mission given by the higher authority.\nTACOM is used where the superior commander recognizes the need\nfor additional resources for a task but requires the resources intact for\na later role. Under TACOM the assigned force is allocated for specific\ntasks and is allocated normally for a limited period of time. This prevents\nthe gaining commander from employing the assigned force in a role\nor manner not intended by the higher commander. When the task is\ncomplete or the specific timeframe expires, the TACOM relationship with\nthe gaining force ends. TACOM is usually applied to specific situations\nand to elements that have unique capabilities.\ne.

The\norganization of a liaison network, especially with the HN, allies, coalition\npartners and the many other agencies likely to be operating in the JOA, can\nassist in gathering information to facilitate the analysis of the capabilities and\nshortfalls of the reception facilities within the JOA. By identifying the shortfalls,\nJTF HQ can, in close conjunction with Allied Command Operations (ACO),\nenhance the infrastructure capabilities within the JOA with military and/or\ncommercially hired installations and facilities.\n2.30 Establishing and protecting lines of communications46. The LOC\nare all the land, water and air routes that connect an operating military\nforce with one or more bases of operations, and along which supplies and\nreinforcements move. Operational LOC are the responsibility of the JTF HQ\nand should be established as early as possible. Operational LOC, particularly\nroad and rail, are rarely only available to NATO forces. The indigenous\npopulation, humanitarian organizations and local forces will all rely on them\ntoo. Early clarity concerning responsibility and authority for the coordination\nof their use and for their maintenance and development will be required. The\nimportant nodes along the LOC are:\n2.31 Port of debarkation. The port of debarkation (POD) is likely to be a\nsea, air or rail port of debarkation through which forces and supplies can be\ndeployed into/close to the JOA.\na. Forward mounting base. A forward mounting base (FMB) is a\nbase, frequently a port, airfield or railhead, from which an operation\nmay be launched into the JOA. A FMB is normally within SACEUR's\narea of responsibility, but not necessarily within the JOA. A FMB must\nbe secured and not be directly exposed to, or at risk from, adversary\naction. An essential stepping stone into the JOA, the FMB should have\nthe capacity for an insertion force to form-up within it, and subsequently\nshould be able to handle reinforcements, reserves and evacuees.

It is recognized that the operating\nenvironment may expand, become more dispersed and non-linear. Distinctions\nbetween forward and rear areas are becoming less clear-cut and urban\nconflict, terrorism, and irregular forces with their inherent asymmetric\ncharacteristics are more commonplace.\n47 See AJP 4.5 Allied Joint Doctrine for Host Nation Support for detail."

Furthermore, even though Alliance political\nauthorities may have approved an operation, further approval may be required\nfor deploying assigned reinforcement forces; lead-time to obtain approval may\nimpact on availability and must be highlighted in the deployment timeline.\n2.37 Deployment responsibilities. The TCNs are primarily responsible, in\nclose conjunction and coordination with SACEUR, for deploying their national\ncontingents from the respective home bases to the PODs. TCNs prepare for\ndeploying their contributions by matching the unit readiness to the readiness of\nthe strategic lift assets needed to effect the deployment. At the strategic level,\nACO is responsible for deployment synchronization issues, strategic military\nguidance and direction to subordinate commanders and therefore coordinates\nnational support. Specifically, ACO develops the multinational detailed\ndeployment plan, monitors and coordinates the use of strategic lift with the\nnations through the allied movement coordination centre, and coordinates,\nprioritizes and de-conflicts strategic movements.\n2.38 Elements of the JTF are capable of self-deployment into and within\nthe JOA. The limits of this relative autonomy are determined by the scale of\nthe supporting equipment, the distance between the reception facilities and\nthe new location, whether staging area, assembly area or AOO, as well as\nby the size of the formation. In specific operations, an autonomous intra-JOA\ndeployment may not be acceptable, e.g., for political reasons or for force\nprotection purposes.\n2.39 Deployment is executed in accordance with SACEUR's approval, based\nupon the commander JTF's required date as well as the relevant direction and\nguidance. One of the key tasks for the JTF HQ and the component commands\nis assessing the situation in the JOA and developing the appropriate mix of\nforces elements in the enabling forces. This task may be made more complex\nby strategic lift constraints, both in capacity and dimension.\n2.40 The commander JTF should be granted coordinating authority at the\nearliest possible stage to facilitate establishing forces in the JOA and to enforce\nthe commander's intent.

This is mainly a task at the\noperational level. NATO commanders and nations should consider three\noverarching principles that apply to RSOMI. These are collective responsibility,\nunity of effort and synchronization. RSOMI of forces is fundamental to the\nconcept of operations that envisions projecting mission-tailored combat power\nwithin a JOA at the right time and in the right sequence.

During the build-up of forces, the joint force may expand\nrapidly in size and the level of burden on the HN(s) by the force may increase\nsignificantly. The commander JTF should endeavour to maintain relations\nwith the HN(s) and maintain support for the joint force presence at a high\nlevel. Public affairs and information activities in the JOA can help to facilitate\nachieving this aim. The JTF should avoid influencing life in the HN(s) to such\na degree that support is weakened or lost. This may require restraint and\nflexibility of conduct, and will require consideration for local customs and\ntraditions by all members of the joint force.\n2.43 The build-up of forces may also be used as a show of force and power\nprojection.

Military strategic direction. Operations design at the operational\nlevel is initiated by a CDS Planning Directive, which is issued to the joint\ncommander (normally the Chief of Joint Operations (CJO)). Once the Prime\nMinister decides to commit military resources, CDS' Operations Directive\nprovides authority to conduct operations. Small deployments or tasks should\nnot require every aspect of the directives to be completed; operational staff\nwork must always be concise.\nUK 2A.6. Turning military strategic objectives into an operation plan. As\ndiscussed in Chapter 1, the operational level is defined as: the level at which\ncampaigns and major operations are planned, conducted, and sustained to\naccomplish strategic objectives within theatres or areas of operations. Allied\nJoint Publication-5, Allied Joint Doctrine for the Planning of Operations guides\nhow planning should be conducted. The operational level links strategic\nobjectives to tactical-level operations. However, direct correlation between\nobjectives being achieved and a desired outcome being reached (favourable\nconditions \"having been created') is complicated by the friction of war. This is\nbecause:\n- crises are complex and that makes them inherently\nunpredictable;\n- the effects, or conditions, cannot always be created as desired\nand, even if created as intended, may not always generate the\ndesired outcome and may create others;\n- the desired outcome may be reached without the identified\nobjectives being achieved;\n- while the foreseen consequences of activities, whether desirable\nor not, can be planned for (and associated risks duly managed),\nthe unforeseen consequences cannot;\n- crises are not amenable to precise management or control;\n- conditions exist, or not, because of myriad factors and\ninfluences; and\n- while commanders may be expected to achieve realistic\nobjectives, they cannot necessarily create specific conditions in\nthe area of operations."

A COP is described as a single identical display of information\nrelevant to an operating environment, shared by more than one\ncommand or system, that facilitates planning and assists all echelons\nto achieve situational awareness. Where integrated technology permits,\na COP should be compiled. The COP may show information such as\nboundaries, last reported locations and the operational effectiveness of\nforce elements; and assessed locations of opponents and other actors\nagainst a common geospatial and temporal reference. Operational\ncommanders should understand the limitations of the data sources\nthat feed a COP and that significant latency may exist with individual\ntracks, particularly in the maritime environment. Understanding the\nlimitations of the COP will enable effective decision making and enhance\nsituational awareness. During multinational operations, a coalition\ncommon operational picture is to be compiled from the tactical pictures\nof the battlespace. It then can be provided in a 'read only' format to\ndesignated recipients by the respective multinational headquarters.

IM is important for the commander's battle rhythm\nand the development and sharing of information to increase both individual\nand collective knowledge. It also promotes understanding of the operating\nenvironment and enables the commander and staff to better formulate and\nanalyze COAs, make decisions, execute those decisions, and understand\nresults from previous decisions. Effective IM improves the speed and accuracy\nof information flow and supports execution through reliable communications.\nThe process is used to manage the organization's information resources and\noptimize access to information by all who need it. As the key joint force staff\nintegrator, the chief of staff (COS) may be responsible for managing the IM\nprocess, while the communications system directorate of a joint staff ensures\nthe operation and connectivity of the supporting CIS and processes. Many\njoint task force headquarters (JTF HQ) will have an IM officer and an IM plan,\nand may also form a joint IM board to serve as a focal point for information\noversight and coordination.

Information flow strategy is developed to ensure that this quality\ninformation gets to the right place on time and in a form that is quickly usable\nby its intended recipients. To that end, the effective flow of information requires\nthe information to be:\na. Right time and place. The requirements for specific types of\ninformation often are predictable. Positioning the required information\nat its anticipated points of need speeds the flow and reduces demands\non the communications system (e.g. using portals and folders to post\nrequired information).\nb. Mobile. The reliable and secure flow of information must be\ncommensurate with the JTF HQ's mobility and operating tempo.\nInformation flow must support vertical and horizontal data sharing (e.g.\ncollaborative planning).\nc. Accessible. All levels of command who have a need to know must\nbe able to pull the information they need to support concurrent or\nparallel planning and mission execution. If possible, channel information\nto the required user via automated means, reducing the need for manual\nexchange (e.g. graphic depiction of forces in a COP)."

Fusion is the logical blending of\ninformation from multiple sources into an accurate, concise, and\ncomplete summary. The main goal of IM is to reduce information to\nits minimum essential elements and in a format that can be easily\nunderstood and acted on (e.g. threat assessment disseminated in\ngraphic form on an automated COP system).\n3.19 Commander's critical information requirements. The commander\nsets the tone for the entire command by establishing priorities for information\nrequirements and dissemination. The commander defines what information is\nneeded and how it should be delivered. Additionally, the commander focuses\nthe staff by designating certain information as critical. These commander's\ncritical information requirements (CCIR) will change over time as the situation\ncontinues to evolve. Properly developed information requirements ensure that\nsubordinate and staff effort is focused, resources are employed efficiently and\ndecisions can be made in a timely manner. Information requirements focus on\nfriendly forces, the operating environment or the adversary. The commander\nwill identify only those information requirements, which are particularly\nimportant to him to maintaining situational awareness and planning future\nactivities. Therefore CCIRs are limited since they must be linked to the critical\ndecisions the commander anticipates making. This focuses the commander's\nsubordinate commanders' and staff's planning and collection efforts.\n3.20 Commanders use CCIRs to help them confirm their vision of the area\nof operations, assess desired effects and to support a decision to accomplish\ntheir mission or to identify significant deviations from that vision due to,\nfor example, adversary actions. CCIRs help the commander to tailor their\ncommand and control organization. They are central to effective information\nmanagement, which directs the processing, flow, and use of information\nthroughout the force. While the staff can recommend CCIRs, only the\ncommander can approve them. CCIRs are continually reviewed and updated\nto reflect the commander's concerns and the changing situation.\n3.21 Knowledge sharing and understanding. Information can be collected,\nprocessed, and stored as structured or unstructured content, such as\nin reports and databases. However, it must be shared to be of value to\ndecision makers. It must also complement IM with processes to create\nan organizational culture that encourages and rewards knowledge and\ninformation sharing to achieve shared understanding. Knowledge sharing is"

For example, the free exchange of ideas between the commander\nand staff that should typify early operations design is an activity that\nshares the individual knowledge of numerous functional experts and\npromotes shared understanding. In a similar way, the after-action\nsessions that a commander conducts with subordinate commanders\nand staff during and following an operation create an environment\nof learning in which participants share knowledge and increase their\ncollective understanding.\nb. Certain products are particularly relevant to understanding. For\nexample, the commander's intent is a knowledge-based product that\ncommanders use to share their insight and direction with the joint task\nforce (JTF). The intent creates shared purpose and understanding,\nprovides focus to the staff, and helps subordinate and supporting\ncommanders act to achieve objectives without further orders, even\nwhen operations do not unfold as planned. Likewise, lessons-learned\ndatabases are knowledge-based products that help users avoid\nprevious mistakes and adopt proven best practices. These databases\nexemplify how IM and decision-support processes can improve future\noperations by sharing knowledge gained through experience.\nc. Another aspect of knowledge sharing and understanding is\ncollaboration, which enhances C2 by sharing knowledge and aiding the\ncreation of shared understanding. Although the value of face-to-face\ninteraction is indisputably preferred, capabilities that improve\nlong-distance, asynchronous collaboration among dispersed forces can\nenhance both planning and execution of joint operations. A collaborative\nenvironment is one in which participants are encouraged to solve\nproblems and share information, knowledge, perceptions, ideas, and\nconcepts in a spirit of mutual cooperation that extends beyond the\nrequirement to coordinate with others. This is particularly important in\nrelationships with interorganizational partners, since their objectives and\nperceptions of the desired end state will not always coincide with the\nmilitary's. Collaboration requires sharing of information with host nation,\nrelevant agencies, interorganizational partners, NGOs, and members"

Monitor. Monitoring involves measuring ongoing activities that\nmay impact the operating environment or impact ongoing or future\noperations. The baseline for this measurement is the plan which allows\nthe staff to assess the current status against the one envisioned\nin the plan. The commander and staff identify where the current\nsituation deviates from the one envisioned in the plan. Although staff\nsections monitor their individual staff functions to maintain current staff\nestimates, the preponderance of the JTF HQ monitoring function is\nconducted by the centres (see para a), and is depicted visually through\nthe COP display.\nb. Assess. Within the JTF HQ decision cycle, assessment is\ndetermining the impact of events as they relate to overall mission\naccomplishment. This is the operations assessment process.\nFundamental to operations assessment are judgments about actual\nprogress in designated mission areas as measured against the\nexpected progress in those same mission areas. These judgments\nallow the commander and the staff to determine where adjustments\nmust be made to operations and serve as a catalyst for planning.\nUltimately, operations assessment allows the commander and staff to\nkeep pace with a constantly evolving situation while staying focused on\nmission accomplishment.\nc.

Tools\nlike the commander's intent and CCIRs assist the commander in this\nrole. The preponderance of the commander's directing function is\nconducted by the joint operations centre (JOC).\n3.24 Battle rhythm. Effective operations require synchronizing strategic,\noperational, and tactical processes, to ensure mission planning, preparation,\nand execution.

It is essentially a schedule of important events that\nshould also be synchronized with other levels of the command. The\nbattle rhythm is commander-centric and all efforts of the staff must be\ndirected toward supporting decision-making.\nb. The JTF HQ battle rhythm consists of a series of meetings, report\nrequirements, and other activities. These activities may be daily, weekly,\nmonthly, or quarterly requirements. Inputs and outputs of the various\nevents should logically support each other as well as decision-making.\nTypically, the JTF HQ battle rhythm is managed by COS.

This will be\nparticularly complicated during multinational operations where the\nsometimes widely varying time zones cause significant dislocation,\nparticularly as the lead nation's requirements will always come first.\n(2) Political considerations. Because military activity is conducted\nunder political authority, the flow up and down the chain of\ncommand to politicians must be accurate and timely. However,\nmilitary networks need to be highly responsive to near real-time\nmedia reporting, which enables politicians to be aware of incidents\nbefore the formal chain of command can draw in all the relevant\nfacts. For the Military Committee (MC) to meet its remit to both\ninform and advise political authorities, as well as take the decisions\nappropriate at that level, the COS has to ensure the staff provides\ninformation in a timely manner up through SACEUR to the MC.\n(3) International influences. The multinational nature of the\noperating environment adds to the briefing requirement. The timing\nof briefings to international authorities or organizations such as\nthe United Nations, Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe, as well as to coalition partners, will have significant\ninfluence on the commander's personal schedule, to the extent that\nit can become their principal activity.\n(4) Shift changes. Shift changes should take place within\nindividual cells in the period after the commander's brief.

Thus, air operations and their associated air tasking\norders are typically planned and executed as a 72 hour cycle (48 hour\nplanning period and 24 hour execution period). Other components have\ndifferent cyclical requirements and action times and the extent to which the\nJTF HQ can coordinate and synchronize the disparate component cycle rates\nwill contribute greatly to force synergy.

They make staff coordination more routine, increase\ncross-functional integration, facilitate monitoring, assessment, and planning,\nprovide venues for commander's decisions, and allow for the management\nof current operations, future operations, and future plans. These can be\nboth physical venues or virtual collaboration and participation with other\nstakeholders and headquarters. As a practical matter, the staff should only\nestablish and maintain those cross-functional organizations that enhance\nplanning and decision-making within the HQ. They establish, modify, and\ndissolve these entities as the needs of the JTF HQ evolve. The cross-functional\norganization of the staff must facilitate the planning and decision-making\nprocesses that are crucial to the JTF HQ success. Figure 3.2 is a notional\ndepiction of the basic relationships within the cross-functional staff structure.\nGenerally, these teams are established and execute planning under the\nsupervision of the chief of staff. As the planning teams move through joint\nplanning process, they ultimately gain guidance, intent, and decisions via\ndesignated decision boards. The commander is kept advised of ongoing,\nnear-term planning initiatives through appropriate mechanisms (e.g., CCIRs,\nserious incident reports, or battle update assessments)."

While this poses\nchallenges for interoperability, prior to execution the commander and staff\nwill have identified the relative strengths and limitations of the available force\ndirectly under command as well as those capabilities being employed by other\npartners and actors not under command. Through common understanding,\nplanning and preparation, the capabilities of the force will have been matched\nto the requirements of the mission.\n3.4 Commander's intent. The commander´s intent is the foundation of the\noperations design. It is a concise, written statement how the commander\nenvisages the forces to conduct the operation. The commander will\ncommunicate the intent to the staff and subordinate commands ensuring\na common understanding. The commander produces the intent based on\nthe findings depicted in the mission analysis and initiates the development\nof the courses of action through the commander´s planning guidance. While\nthere is no specified format for the commander's intent, a generally accepted\nconstruct includes the purpose and objective(s).\na. Purpose. The purpose explains to what end the military action\nis being conducted. The purpose helps the force pursue the mission\nwithout further orders, even when actions do not unfold as planned\nand it enables exploitation when the execution unfolds more favourable\nthan expected.

Build and maintain relationships. Effort spent in building\nrelationships both within and outside the force will contribute to\ngenerating understanding, trust and confidence from a shared situation\nand similar experiences. Credibility and patience will further enhance\na commander's ability to build relationships especially with non-NATO\npartners and actors.\nd. Maintain morale. Morale, the confidence and well-being felt\nby individuals and groups, is generated and maintained through a\ncombination of factors in which the commander has a key role to play.\nThese factors are: effective leadership; discipline (both personal and\ncollective); shared experience; and a shared common goal.\ne. Extend personal influence. Commanders are likely to be required\nto generate influence over domestic, international and host-nation\ndecision-makers and audiences. Key to this is identifying the point,\naudience or actor where the most effective influence can be generated\nand maintained, underpinned by credible military capability where\nappropriate.\nf. Remain agile. By remaining agile a commander is able to seize\nand retain the initiative, and maintain decision making advantage over\nadversaries, to exploit opportunities and reinforce success. Agility will\nimprove resource effectiveness, since a commander will be able to\nidentify changes required in the weight of effort. This will contribute to\nensuring that opportunities created by success are exploited and that\nredundant activity is minimized.\n3.7 Locating the command. How best to command a force, and from\nwhere, is an important part of execution. Identifying the location is the\njoint responsibility of the commander and staff and depends on the type\nof operation and the stage or phase. The most suitable position for the\ncommander is always where they can best lead and make decisions.\nCommunication and information systems (CIS) provides the means for\ncommanders and their staff to access information, which in turn supports\ndecision-making and issuing direction and guidance. CIS may also allow a\ncommander choice of location (alongside considering the requirements of the\noperation and the prevailing situation) and it may allow them to be physically\nseparated from their main headquarters (HQ). However, a commander's\nlocation should always allow them to:"

However in\nmany cases, the most that can be achieved may only be de-confliction.\n3.9 Coordination. When two or more force elements operate in the same\nbattlespace their activities should be coordinated, and where necessary,\nintegrated. Where these activities are concurrent and cannot be separated,\nthey should be subject to some form of control. The degree of control required\ndepends on a range of factors, for example on the extent to which the force\nelements are required to interact, and is dependent upon the level of shared\nsituational awareness across the joint force. Coordination and control may be\nbased on interaction between organizations and are procedural in nature.\n3.10 Synchronization. Synchronized actions, within the overall construct\nof orchestrated actions, is standard practice at the operational level.\nSynchronizing action often require force elements to agree and commit, in\nadvance, to coordinating courses of action (COAs) to resolve anticipated\nconflict. Synchronized actions may comprise elements working independently\n(but known to each other) and/or elements working closely together. This\napproach enables the efforts of otherwise discrete force elements to be\nconcentrated, at a time and place that is anticipated to be decisive; it does not\nnecessarily optimize use of the battlespace nor provide a commander with\nmaximum agility."

The benefits of this approach are\nclear: increased scope for mission command; enhanced operational tempo;\nmore efficient operations conduct ; and the opportunity to introduce confusion\namongst the adversary. The attendant risks must be considered, such as\nthat of autonomous action, for example in the absence of full situational\nawareness, leading to friendly fire. Synchronizing actions requires significant\nstaff planning and rehearsal, but has the benefit of reducing risks. Dynamic\nsynchronization possibly offers greater rewards but relies heavily on the\nability of force elements, and commanders at all levels, to respond effectively\nto changes in the operational situation. At all levels, dynamic coordination\nand synchronization requires communications and information systems to\nenable both situational awareness and effective command and control. Thus,\noperations management is facilitated through a combination of battlespace\nmanagement and shared situational awareness.\nBattlespace management\n3.12 Battlespace management describes the necessary adaptive means and\nmeasures and procedures that enable the dynamic synchronization of activities\nin the battlespace. Battlespace management combines and integrates\nthe elements of a joint force to accomplish the commander's intent and\nmission; it is thus a key enabler to the success of joint operations. Integrating\nforce elements through battlespace management procedures enables\ncoordination and synchronization according to the commander's priorities.\nBattlespace management is not an end in itself, but a process that facilitates\nand seeks to maximize operational effectiveness and minimize constraints\nand can contribute to reducing the risk of fratricide. A detailed discussion on\nbattlespace management is at Annex C Battlespace management, planning\nand execution, however the main elements of battlespace management are:\n- coordinating and synchronizing the activities of force elements,\nincluding non-NATO actors;\n- contributing to situational awareness and freedom of action; and\n- mitigating friction caused by the existence of boundaries and\nseams between force elements and between the joint force and\nother actors."

While\ndifferent means and measures are relevant at the different levels, all activities\nrequire a degree of integration, coordination, synchronization and prioritization.\nStrategic battlespace management considerations include diplomatic\nagreements for access and overflight. At the operational level, battlespace\nmanagement focuses on issues such as competing demands for host-nation\nsupport.

Operations assessment is critical because no planning\nprocess can guarantee success, and progress must be continually reviewed\nagainst achievement of objectives so that plans can be adjusted as necessary.\nAn important element of operational art, operations assessment has to be\nconsidered at the outset of an operation, continuously throughout an operation\nand periodically. It must be done formally to support the preparation of the\nperiodic mission report and at an operation's conclusion.\n4.2 Operations assessment provides evidence for adjustment to the\nplan, decision-making and to provide formal feedback on the progress\nand results of an operation. Results of assessment may also inform the\nlessons process and deliver input to risk management. Whichever process is\nadopted it requires sound military judgement at its heart and cannot become\nmechanistic. Operations assessment should maintain the differentiation\nbetween performance and effectiveness but avoid adding unnecessary\nburden on staffs by compelling them to develop a huge amount of quantitative\nmeasurements and to collect the supporting data.\n4.3 Beyond measuring progress, informing decisions and focusing planning\nthere are several other key reasons for conducting operations assessment.\na. Operations assessment uses structured methods to gather and\ncollate evidence over the duration of the operation and preserves\nan institutional memory that can be used to learn from each other's\nexperiences.\nb.

The structured process enables the military to keep track of and\nshare information with other non-military actors resulting in a better\nunderstanding of the interconnections and interdependencies between\nmilitary and non-military activity and how they should be coordinated\nand synchronized. This supports a comprehensive approach.\nSection 2 – Stages of operations\nassessment\n4.4 The operations assessment process involves four stages:\n- assessment design and support to planning;\n- development of a data collection plan;\n- data collection and treatment; and\n- analysis, interpretation and recommendations.\n4.5 Assessment design and support to planning and development of a\ndata collection plan will be conducted during operations planning, while data\ncollection and treatment, and analysis, interpretation and recommendations\nwill be conducted continuously during execution.

Measuring system states can\nbegin as soon as the key elements for monitoring are identified, even before\na plan is developed. This establishes a baseline and supports creating effects\nand achieving objectives. This results in an overall evaluation of progress\ntowards the North Atlantic Treaty Organization end state and the subsequent\ndevelopment of conclusions and recommendations that support military\nstrategic decision making for the strategic military Commander, and informing\nthe North Atlantic Council.\n4.8 At the operational level operations assessment focusses on the desired\neffects and is aligned with the planning horizons to support both operations\nsynchronization (mid-term planning) and operations planning (long-term\nplanning). This distinction is not a fundamental delineation between a mid-term\nand a long-term operations assessment but rather a difference in emphasis.\nAn assessment of progress towards the end of the current phase or upcoming\ndecisive conditions is required to support course of action development\nor adjustment and, possibly, branch planning; whereas an assessment\nof progress towards the achievement of objectives is required to support\nplanning for sequels, termination and transition.\nOperations assessment feeds the commander's decision cycle"

One of the most important factors in planning the redeployment is\ntiming. It will be extremely difficult to formulate a redeployment plan before\nthe end state has either been attained or subsequent operations have been\ndetermined. Equally, it will reflect badly upon the conduct of the operation if the\nredeployment is seen to be a rushed, poorly planned affair. Therefore, it is vital\nthat it is treated in the same thorough manner as the deployment and adequate\ntime is given to its planning and preparation and redeployment should be\nconsidered from the beginning of the operation.\n5.17. Planning factors. There are several factors requiring consideration\nduring redeployment planning.\na. Clear and detailed operational and logistic requirements to\ndetermine the scale of the redeployment.\nb. Establishing a planning team.\nc. Residual commitments, for example specialist logistic personnel,\nmay remain in the JOA in an advisory capacity, e.g. to help\nreconstruction.\nd. \"Earliest move' and \"All out by' timings should be clarified at the\nearliest stage to identify lead times and enable strategic lift planning to\nproceed.\ne. Establishing specialist teams to staff the hand-over of HN assets\nand to coordinate termination of contracts. If the JTF has relied upon\nhost-nation support, then a duty of care to the hosts exists. Every\neffort must be taken to ensure that environmental, political or financial\ndifficulties do not degrade the relationship with the HN.\nf. Additional enabling force elements and specialists may be required to\ndeploy to the JOA to facilitate the redeployment. These will require force\ngenerating, deploying and redeploying.\ng. Identifying the strategic movement assets to be made available by\nthe troop-contributing nations."

Military activities\nwill usually not suffice to attain the end state. While every operation is directed\ntowards a goal, at some point military action is no longer the main effort. It may\nbe necessary for one mission to change the operations theme or terminate\nand be replaced by another as part of a wider strategic plan. The commander\nshould focus on what happens when the objectives have been achieved,\nhow to preserve what has been gained, and how to ensure it endures. As the\nobjectives may be achieved before the end state is attained, a follow-on force\nor adjusted mission may be required.\nSection 2 – Termination\n5.2. Operations should be planned and conducted with a clear\nunderstanding of the end state and the corresponding acceptable conditions\nthat should exist to end operations. It is the strategic commander's\nresponsibility to make the appropriate examination and to determine\ntermination criteria which describe military and non-military conditions that\njustify the recommendation to terminate operations.\na. Termination criteria influence the elements of operations design\nas they enable development of military objectives. Termination criteria\ndescribe the standards that should be met.\nb. Termination criteria should account for a wide variety of\noperational tasks that the joint force may need to conduct, to include\ndisengagement, force protection, transition to post-conflict operations,\nreconstitution and redeployment.\nc.

As such, it is essential for the military to maintain\na dialogue between actors.\nSection 3 – Transition\n5.3. Transitioning is a conditions-based activity. Transition can take several\nforms, some of which are:\n- transition from one North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) force to\nanother;\n- transition from NATO to non-NATO military forces;\n- transition from NATO to a United Nations non-military force; or\n- transition from NATO to host nation (HN) forces or civilian control.\n5.4. Transition activities comprise the progressive transfer of functions,\nsupporting institutions, infrastructures and responsibilities between actors to\nreach an enduring level of capability for the HN so that it is not dependent on a\nsignificant operational NATO military contribution. The aim is to transition all the\nfunctions performed by the joint force in an orderly fashion. Some functions\nmay develop into activities conducted by a combination of Alliance and local\ngovernment and security as transition advances. Once all transitions are\ncomplete, the Alliance force can depart or remain, but under a new or revised\nmandate.\n5.5. The commander joint task force (JTF) should plan for termination\nand the transition phase as soon as possible. From the start of operations\nplanning, activities aimed at initiating and shaping the transition process may\nbe considered. Forces involved should work towards an effective transfer of\nresponsibility to ensure coherence. Transitions between military forces may\ntake the form of relief-in-place, or transition-by-function, such as medical and\nengineer services."

Transitions are often a period of risk and uncertainty in which gains\nmade by the Alliance and other actors can be reversed if the correct structures\nare not in place to underpin a long-term sustainable solution. Poorly timed and\nill-conceived transitions will generally foster and perpetuate instability. Regions\nor institutions may transition at different times and this should be recognized\nand incorporated into the transition plan to ensure success. The transition\nplan will be based on realistic, accurate and shared understanding of the\ncapabilities, responsibilities and resources of the participants.\n5.7. Security transition strategies must contribute to sustaining security in\nthe post-transition environment. The transition process is part of a longer-term\nreform and transformation process that will be managed by other actors. The\nAlliance should be prepared to provide security capabilities until they can be\nrelieved by local forces or other actors.\n5.8. Transitions are negotiated processes with the HN and other actors.\nThis makes them non-linear and dependent on HN political processes and\ninterests, which may change over time. Flexibility is vital, requiring those\nplanning transition activities to identify the range and limits of acceptable\noutcomes and to work within those limits to develop the transition plan.\n5.9.

Therefore, no one actor will have the freedom to\nplan and execute transition activities alone. In particular, NATO must cooperate\nwith those agencies involved in activities that will outlast any significant military\npresence. There are three key aspects that must shape any approach to\ntransition activities.\na. Transitions are a multinational and inter-agency process. Transitions\ntypically occur within multinational and inter-agency environments,\nwith multiple actors and agencies working within a HN on security,\ngovernance and rule of law. This environment creates dependencies\nbetween actors.\nb. Transitions are a negotiated process. All actors, including the\nwider population, will have a view on the shape of any post-transition\nsecurity environment – and such views may conflict. Negotiating the\nshape of this future security environment is more important than solely\nfocusing on technical capability building. Commanders must develop a\nflexible, sustainable, technically-sound and politically-sensitive transition\napproach. Simple, flexible plans will allow greater resilience to any\nshocks or setbacks and commanders should aim for an acceptable\nrange of outcomes. Understanding what defines this acceptable range\nis a key element of any transition activities planning.\nc. Transitions are informed by operations assessment. Monitoring the\nprogress of transition activities (including perceptions, relationships and\nbehaviours) is vital to enable commanders to identify whether they have\nachieved their objectives or to adjust their activities as necessary. As a\nresult, initial transition terms may be re-evaluated.\nAssessing transition activities\n5.10. Assessing transition activities that emphasizes continuous learning\nand analysis is required to adapt planning to the transition environment.\nAssessment frameworks should allow progress to be tracked with risks and\nissues being recognized and addressed early. Markers should be identified\nto detect and assess development progress. Security transition assessment\nshould comprehensively consider related HN systems to promote and facilitate\nsynchronization, coordination and integration. Moreover, identifying decisive\nconditions will assist in setting assessment and transition activities. Without a\nholistic approach to assessment, elements of transition activities may become\nuncoordinated, especially if multiple actors are involved."

Engaging with multinational and inter-agency actors, as well as those\nwithin the HN, provides effective means for building shared ownership and\nunderstanding of transition activities. Commanders must consider (and review)\nif the transition activities and the way in which NATO engages in them accord\nwith the key aspects of a successful transition.\nEffective transition activities\n5.12. Transitions planning should enable commanders to both track specific\nprogress against transitions plans and monitor the way in which partners are\nbehaving and engaging. Commanders should consider the following:\na. Political primacy and focus. Those involved in transition activities\nmust be aware of the political situation, maintaining a political focus\nresponsive to the internal politics of the HN while being embedded\nwithin the international environment and wider political context.\n(1) Flexibility. Transition plans must accommodate uncertainty\nand be capable of flexible adaptation to a changing political\ncontext. Commanders should be prepared to react to change\nand remain flexible so that NATO can respond to opportunities or\nthreats as they arise.\n(2) Identifying and understanding what motivates\nactors. Transitions incorporate multiple actors and the interests of\nthese groups and their sub-groups may be disputed. Transition\ninitiatives must be considered in the context of their impact on the\nmotivations and interests of these different actors.\n(3) Balancing international and indigenous knowledge. NATO\nand other international actors can offer specific capability and\ntechnical knowledge while HN actors will have a more nuanced\nunderstanding of social structures, and appropriate local solutions.\nLocally-influenced solutions are likely to be more durable than those\ndesigned solely by international actors.\nb. Legitimacy. It is important to specify what legitimacy entails and\nin whose eyes; developing domestic legitimacy provides long-term\nstability. Without legitimacy, transition activities may lack popular\nsupport and the broader political process could be undermined and will\ntherefore be less likely to endure."

Sustainability. Longer-term success will rely on developing\nsustainable models and organizations that can provide effective\nday-to-day security while understanding the implications of these\nactions on the overall population. Sustainability should therefore\nbe examined with regard to politics, organizations, processes and\nresources. Sustainable balanced security institutions need to develop,\nand legal processes must be sustainable by the HN. As security\ntransitions are frequently resource-intensive periods for the HN,\nresources may need to be sustained post-transition, including the\nprovision of financial support or training56.\nd. Communication strategy. Transition activities must be supported\nby a communication strategy that creates an accurate understanding of\nNATO's actions and intentions among audiences in support of NATO's\ninterests and objectives.\nTransition risks\n5.13. Transition activities comprise an element of risk. Impact may extend\nbeyond the tactical and operational levels. Commanders at all levels should\nconsider the following risks when planning and assessing transition activities:\na. Timing. Transitions may occur before actors feel fully confident\nand capable. The time required for capability and legitimacy to develop\nwill need to be balanced with the risks that emerge from not achieving\nkey security goals. Transitioning too soon can lead to deterioration in\nsecurity and, ultimately, strategic mission failure. Premature transition\nactivities may lead to a requirement to re-engage. Delayed transition\nactivities may result in increased dependency.\nb. State instability. The political settlement and elements of the state\nmay remain vulnerable for some time both during and after transition\nactivities.\nc. Human rights abuses. Where parties to the conflict have been\nresponsible for human rights abuse and Law of Armed Conflict\ninfringements, the risks of retributive violence must be carefully\nassessed and mitigated. Abuse within the security and justice system\ncan further undermine governance and hamper the transition and\n56 See AJP-3.16 Allied Joint Doctrine for Security Force Assistance and AJP-3.22 Allied\nJoint Doctrine for Stability Policing for detail."

The risks are highest where integrating former combatants\ninto the security apparatus is taking place or where state institutions, as\nwell as conflicting parties, behave in a predatory manner towards the\ncivilian population.\nd. Conflict of interests. Tensions may emerge regarding the scope\nand vision for transition among HN parties, neighbouring countries and\ninternational actors engaged in the transition. These interests must be\ncarefully negotiated and managed.\ne. Legitimacy. If transition activities are not seen as legitimate, it\nis unlikely to endure. Those engaged in transition activities should\ntherefore consider the implications of any choices they make on the\nlegitimacy of their HN counterparts and support developing their\nlegitimacy wherever possible.\nf. Pursuing own political interests. Powerful actors may seek to use\nthe transition to further their own or their group's political purposes. This\nwill undermine the legitimacy of the HN government and the transition\nprocess, and may ultimately lead to a return to violence or, in extreme\ncases, security sector collapse.\nSection 4 – Post termination activities\n5.14. Redeployment. The redeployment of forces57 after termination of an\noperation is a highly complex political, military, economic and environmental\nmatter. It is not simply a case of reversing the deployment plan, but rather a\ndistinct operation in its own right. Redeployment comprises three phases at\nthe minimum: planning, preparatory activities and execution. Redeployment\nmay be directed when operations have terminated or higher authority directs\nmovement of the assigned force. The joint force command should give the\nsame considerations to redeployment as for deployment in regard to phasing\nof command and control (C2) and the desired order of departure. Specific\nenablers may deploy to the joint operations area (JOA) to help close locations,\nassist with drawing down support activities and provide specialist assets, skills\nand advice to redeploy personnel and materiel.

Where possible the UK will adopt\nNATO doctrine (Allied joint publications) rather than producing national\ndoctrine (joint doctrine publications). Where it cannot, the UK will ensure it\nremains compatible. As a result the UK doctrine architecture comprises:\n- NATO Allied joint publications distributed in the UK for use on\ncoalition operations as appropriate;\n- NATO Allied joint publications promulgated as UK national joint\ndoctrine; and\n- UK joint doctrine publications promulgated as UK national joint\ndoctrine.\nWhere an Allied joint publication is promulgated as UK national doctrine,\nthe cover will carry both the MOD and NATO emblems.

AJP-3(C) is intended primarily as guidance for joint NATO commanders\nand staffs. However, the doctrine is instructive to, and provides a useful\nframework for operations conducted by a coalition of NATO members,\npartners and non-NATO nations. It also provides a reference for NATO civilian\nand non-NATO civilian actors.\nChange 1 for UK national elements\nUK 1. UK Change 1 has revised the national direction on componency\nthat was previously captured within the national elements of Section 3. The\nnew section on \"modern componency' reflects a step-change in the UK\napproach to componency, which has traditionally been applied to the three\nsingle Services in response to crisis operations. It reflects the expansion of\noperational domains to include both space, and cyber and electromagnetic,\nand greater capacity across the single Services to operate coherently as\ncomponent commands. This revision contains much greater detail than\nprevious editions on how Chief of Joint Operations, as the UK's principal\njoint operational commander, aims to delegate operational activity to the\ncomponents based on a delegated model of scale, risk and complexity\nwith the aim of elevating the Permanent Joint Headquarters outlook and"

It details OPSEC and\ndeception principles, roles, responsibilities and relationships with other staff\nfunctions.\n1.2.\nSurprise and security are two of the twelve principles of joint and multinational\noperations;1 OPSEC and deception support these principles. AJP-5, Allied Joint\nDoctrine for the Planning of Operations identifies the need to consider building\ndeliberate surprise in the operations design and highlights that the side that is able\nto generate information advantage is in a position to seize the initiative; OPSEC and\ndeception will be key to achieving surprise and seizing the initiative.\n1.3.\nOPSEC and deception planning are required against all adversaries.2 It is critical\nthat OPSEC and deception planning is taken into account from the outset of the\nplanning process at the strategic, operational and tactical echelons of command.\nThe manoeuvrist approach to operations applies strength against vulnerabilities,\noften through indirect means, using ingenuity as opposed to physically destroying\na capability. NATO must achieve an intellectual edge by developing innovative and\ndisruptive thinking. Commanders, planners and operators should be agile thinkers\nand decision-makers encouraged to outmanoeuvre adversaries. OPSEC and\ndeception are separate but mutually supporting processes that can save resources\nand lives, while causing adversaries to waste combat power with inappropriate or\ndelayed actions. OPSEC and deception are force multipliers, which support the\ncommander achieving their objectives by providing greater freedom of action.\n1.4.\nLegal. Provided it is not perfidious or otherwise prohibited by law or policy,\ndeception is a legitimate military activity and is a ruse of war. In an armed conflict,\ndeception must comply with the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), as reflected in\ncustomary and treaty law, including Article 37 of the First 1977 Protocol Additional\nto the 1949 Geneva Conventions. National caveats and interpretations will also\napply. LOAC permits ruses of war as acts intended to mislead an adversary or\ninduce them to act recklessly, which do not infringe a rule of international law.\nDeception techniques must not constitute perfidious acts. Perfidy is described as\nan act inviting the confidence of an adversary, to lead them to believe they are\nentitled to, or obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law\n1 Allied Joint Publication (AJP)-01, Allied Joint Doctrine.\n2 For military operations, NATOTerm defines adversary as: \"a party acknowledged as potentially hostile and against\nwhich the legal use of force may be envisaged'. This publication will use the term adversary to also mean enemy, and\ntherefore also hostile, as this is how most Allied joint publications use the term."

This requires a thorough understanding of the\nadversary's intent and their ability to exploit vulnerabilities.\n2.3.\nSeemingly unimportant information can be aggregated to form a more complete\npicture of operations and planned activities.

OPSEC assessments are the responsibility of OPSEC-\ntrained staff, although they will require supporting information from other staff. The\nOPSEC staff must work closely with the intelligence staff to identify the risk, analyze\nthe risk and evaluate the risk.18 Planning or conducting operations and activities will\nincrease the likelihood of indicators and create vulnerabilities for exploitation,\nparticularly with civil-military interaction (CMI). An OPSEC vulnerability exists when\nthe adversary is capable of collecting EEFI, analyzing them and has the time to act\nand exploit the situation. OPSEC assessments establish a baseline signature for\nthe respective units.\na.\nRisk identification. The OPSEC staff must consider the activity of planning\nitself, as well as the conduct of activity, from an adversarial perspective to\ndetermine where vulnerabilities lie. They must consider both these elements\nof OPSEC risk to support course of action (COA) development, analysis,\nvalidation and comparison, to determine which COA is most supportable from\nan OPSEC perspective.\nb.\nRisk analysis. The risk analysis is balanced between the probability of\nadversary collection and the impact of successful adversary collection.\nDetermining the level of risk is important, as this justifies the requirement for\nOPSEC, which may have effort, cost and time implications. The OPSEC staff\nmust identify which channels, including open-source intelligence, could detect\nthe EEFI and provide this information to the adversary.\nc.\nRisk evaluation. For each vulnerability identified, the OPSEC staff will\nevaluate the intent and capability of adversaries to collect, analyze and exploit\nfriendly force EEFI and indicators. This will require coordination across the\nstaff and must include the resources required, synchronization, operations\nassessment and termination arrangements for the plan to be executed\nefficiently\n2.9.\nStep 3: Apply OPSEC measures. Once the commander has selected the COA,\nthe OPSEC staff should identify the relevant OPSEC measures required to treat\nrisks and finalize the plan to enforce them. This must include the resources required,\nsynchronization, operations assessment and termination arrangements. This\nprocess is continually fed from risk assessment. It may involve not taking the risk\nand ceasing activity, or taking and perhaps increasing the risk to seize an\nopportunity. It may also involve removing the risk source or changing the\nconsequences, which could include deception. All friendly forces have a role to play\nin applying OPSEC measures.\n2.10.\nStep 4: Monitor and review effectiveness of OPSEC measures. The OPSEC\nstaff must evaluate the risk treatment provided by the OPSEC process. This should\nbe a planned part of the process and must allow for continuous monitoring and\nreview. OPSEC plans can fail if EEFI are disclosed unintentionally. Continual\nmonitoring and reviewing of the OPSEC process is essential.

However, the use\nof deception might be subject to other legal or policy limitations, including rules of\nengagement.\n1.5.\nThe information environment. The information environment comprises two main\nfacets; firstly, the cognitive, virtual and physical spaces that exist within it and\nsecondly, the interrelationships between them. Current technology provides\nindividuals and groups with the ability to create, store, manage, control, manipulate\nand transmit information quickly and easily. This has in turn created an increased\ndependency on information and information technology by states and other actors.\nInformation is subject to preconception, bias, agenda, manipulation and\ninterpretation by both the transmitter and receiver. The modern environment brings\nchallenges with the extensive proliferation and sophistication of information\ncollection tools and technologies. Simultaneously, it provides greater access to\nopinions and a more intimate understanding of motivations, as well as numerous\nnew conduits for projecting specific perceptions and information to targets and\naudiences. The information age exposes warfare to greater public scrutiny because\nof the proliferation of digital media5 channels, smartphones and other smart devices.\nAn understanding of this environment and an ability to operate within it are vital, as\nit will present both a threat and an opportunity for OPSEC and deception. As with\nall relevant activity, OPSEC and deception must be coherent with the strategic\nnarrative.\n1.6.\nThe relationship with information operations. OPSEC and deception are\ndiscrete information-related activities and not coordinated solely by information\noperations (Info Ops). Info Ops is the staff function that coordinates information\nactivities to create effects on will, understanding and capability. To maintain\ncredibility of the overall messaging, the information activities within OPSEC and\ndeception plans have to be coordinated with Info Ops, as with any other discrete\nprocess or capability, if not compartmentalized for security reasons. This will ensure\nthat other NATO-related activities such as military public affairs (PA) and\ncivil-military cooperation, which have no role in planning or executing deception, do\nnot contradict the promotion of the narrative.\n1.7.\nAchieving a behavioural response. Deception is a psychological process and\nseeks a behavioural response, be it action or inaction. For the purposes of this\npublication, a behavioural response is a cognitive reaction to a stimulus that then\n3 Examples of perfidy are: the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; the feigning of an\nincapacitation by wounds or sickness; the feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and the feigning of protected status\nby the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other states not party to the conflict.\n4 Including internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar\nnature.\n5 Digital media is any medium of communication using digital content.

Operational-level deception may support a strategic\ndeception plan, involving force elements and resources outside of the joint\noperations area. Operational-level deception may require coordination with the\nstrategic headquarters and other government departments and may require\napproval of the strategic commander. Operational-level deception will also direct\ndeception plans down to the tactical level and the component commanders, as\ntactical action can have strategic effects and consequences.\n3.2.\nOperational-level deception operates within the medium to short term. It aims to\nachieve a positive result that supports the commander's plan. Planned centrally, it\nmaintains operations security (OPSEC) and continuity from the strategic to the\ntactical level. It should unfold logically and realistically, feeding the adversary with\nthe combat indicators they would expect to see, yet not so obviously as to raise\nsuspicion. Adversarial intelligence must have enough time to collect and interpret\nfalse information, but not sufficient time to conduct too thorough an analysis.\n3.3.\nAppropriate conditions to conduct deception. Consider deception if favourable\nconditions for its successful execution exist and it is likely to provide significant\nadvantage. This is a decision for the JFC and their staff based upon the experience\nand judgment. Conditions when using deception may be appropriate include when:\n\uF0B7\nthe adversary has an advantage that cannot be overcome without using\ndeception – force strengths, capability, agility or situational awareness;\n\uF0B7\nthe adversary has known preconceptions that can be exploited;\n\uF0B7\nthe adversary has known flaws in their decision-making process;\n\uF0B7\nthe adversary is under pressure to act;\n\uF0B7\ndeception will enhance OPSEC;\n\uF0B7\ndeception will enhance the effectiveness of a conventional approach; or\n\uF0B7\na target can only be influenced indirectly.\n3.4.\nRisk. Deception planners must understand the risks involved in carrying out\ndeception and must utilize the risk management process in presenting courses of\naction (COA) to the commander.

Deception can be effective even with a small\namount of information placed across a wide variety of channels. For both ambiguity\ndecreasing deception and ambiguity increasing deception the consistency of the\ndeception input is important. In both cases, multiple channels used with consistent\ndata will increase the likelihood of target audience acceptance, as verifiability is\nobtained. Planners should employ only as many deceptive activities as required for\nthe targeted decision-maker to take the action (or inaction) that will create the\ndesired exploitable advantage.\nOperation DESERT STORM (1991) – The Hail Mary20 deception play\n\"The movement of the enemy's columns into battle can be ascertained only by actual\nobservation – the point at which he plans to cross a river by the few preparations he\nmakes, which become apparent a short time in advance; but the direction from which he\nthreatens our country will usually be announced in the press before a single shot is fired.\nThe greater the scale of preparations, the smaller the chance of achieving a surprise.'21\nAlthough Clausewitz was discussing strategic reserves in this passage, he identifies the\nopportunity for achieving surprise by deception, while also alluding to the challenges\nand opportunities of operating within the information environment of his time. General H\nNorman Schwarzkopf (commander of the coalition forces deployed on Operation\nDESERT SHIELD during the \"Gulf War' 1990/1991) also understood this.\nA large-scale deception operation was critical to the coalition's plan to liberate Kuwait\nfrom the Iraqi forces of Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi forces were deployed in a series of\ndefensive lines focused on preventing the forced withdrawal of Iraqi forces from illegally\noccupied Kuwait from a coalition of 39 nations, deployed on the Saudi Arabia border\nand afloat in the Persian Gulf, against which the Iraqis had numerical superiority.\nThrough multiple approaches from the political to the operational level, the coalition\ndeception plan reinforced the existing beliefs of the Iraqi high command that the\ncoalition would not attack through Iraq but only through Kuwait and in doing so they\nwould approach from the east incorporating an amphibious landing. A deception\noperation was a credible, consistent, verifiable and executable option, as Iraqi forces\nfaced a coalition that appeared to be deployed to fight another protracted attritional Iran-\nIraq war (1980-88) – warfighting the Iraqis were well prepared for, channelled by a\ndesert to the west that the Iraqis believed was too difficult to navigate in or manoeuvre\nthrough.

The intelligence estimate will seek to understand the totality of the\noperating environment, ranging from battlespace area evaluation to a detailed\nunderstanding of the societal factors and an analysis of the adversary's capabilities\nand intentions. It is essential that J2 collects against the totality of the adversary's\ncommand, control and decision-making apparatus, with particular attention paid to\ntrying to understand what assessments adversarial intelligence is making; this will\nallow the deception planner to scope the possibility of a deception plan. It is also\ncritical for the J2 branch to assist the deception planner to understand the overall\ninformation environment, to include the social media landscape and the way\ninformation flows in the country or countries forming the joint operations area.\nUnderstanding the relationships between populations and civil society and both\nhostile organizations and friendly forces is critical.

This requires an analysis of the time\navailable, the level of friendly force understanding, the availability of resources, the\nadversarial collection and analytical capability and their ability to react to the plan\nand change their behaviour.

Vertical coordination is required to confirm that tactical\ndeceptions do not undermine operational-level deception plans. In turn, any\noperational-level deception should not undermine or expose the strategic plan.\nCoordination will have to take place not just between deception planners at various\nlevels but also between deception planners and other staff planners. For example,\nthe deception planner may require the adversary to monitor electronic warfare\ntransmissions and therefore their capability to do so should not be jammed or\ndestroyed via the targeting process.\na.\nResources. The planner must identify the activities and indicators that require\nresourcing to deliver the developing story and its monitoring. These activities\nmay be delivered by component commands; the deception planner must be\nsatisfied that the indicators being shown to the adversary can be discovered\nand identified.\nb.\nSynchronization. A sequential plan should be developed with a detailed list\nof necessary resources, as failure to implement a stage, or a deviation in\ntimings, could result in a misinterpretation of the indicators, or could\ncompromise the operation. The plan should include the desired adversary's\nreaction to each event, for use in the monitoring process. Sequence the\ndeception to maximize the portrayal of the deception story.\nc.\nMonitoring. Feedback is paramount; a resourced collection plan will facilitate\nexploitation of the deception. The intelligence collection plan will attempt to\nidentify if the deception is being accepted, rejected or deceptively countered.\nNominate deception-related priority intelligence requirements and establish\nnamed areas of interest and target areas of interest.\nd.\nOperations assessment. The deception plan should include the desired\nreaction to each significant sequence of events, so that the deception planner\nknows whether the adversary is responding and behaving in the desired\nmanner. This desired reaction may itself become a commander's critical\ninformation requirement in its own right. The operations assessment (OpsA)\nprocess will enable the measurement of progress and outcomes of the\ndeception and assist the commander in evaluating the benefit of the deception.\nSee Section 6 for more detail on OpsA.\ne.\nTermination. The termination of a successful deception must be included in\nthe plan. Even when the deception is successful, commanders and their staffs\nmay wish to keep all, or elements, of it undisclosed.

Supporting capabilities require enough knowledge to\naccomplish their tasks without drawing undue attention to their activities. It is\nimportant to coordinate deception planning with the OPSEC process to reduce the\nadversary's ability to detect and determine the planned deception. This coordination\ndoes not solely rest within the planning phase; it must also take place through the\nexecution and at termination. For OPSEC purposes, give the deception plan an\noperation name and do not refer to it as the deception plan.\n3.22.\nPlan approval. The commander may review the deception plan and approve it as\npart of normal operations, or may wish to compartmentalize the approvals process\ndue to sensitivities. Consult the legal advisor (LEGAD) and the political advisor\n(POLAD), and where appropriate information operations (Info Ops), prior to seeking\napproval. The approval authority for deception at the operational level will initially\nbe Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR); SACEUR may delegate\nauthority. Certain capabilities or assets used to implement deception may also\nrequire approvals at a higher level than the JFC; address this as early as possible.\nThe operational-level targeting process will provide guidance on any restraints or\nconstraints during target development.\n3.23.\nPlan distribution. The deception plan should be distributed as an annex to the\nOPLAN only for those staffs that require knowledge of its existence. To reduce the\nrisk of compromise, units and formations involved in the implementation of\ndeception should know only enough to fulfil their role in the plan but not to\ncompromise the overall plan.\nSection 5 – Execution\n3.24.\nPersistent presence and disclosure. The requirement for OPSEC means that\nmonitoring any alterations to friendly force plans and activities is as important as\nadversarial activity. It ensures that commanders who are not aware of the deception\nplan do not inadvertently alter the target, the story, or resources for the plan, through\nlack of awareness. Decide which staff officers and subordinate commands should\nbe aware of the deception plan. The output of macro-level boards such as the\nInformation Activities Coordination Board (IACB) and Joint Targeting Coordination\nBoard (JTCB) should be monitored.\n3.25.\nSituational awareness.

It will contain many interdependent events,\nwith seemingly minor occurrences (and their subsequent implantation in the\nadversarial mind) many days previously, giving credence to later, larger events.\nTherefore, changes to the plan require detailed consideration of all available\nintelligence derived from the monitoring process. It is also possible that later\nchanges, unless very carefully implemented, could compromise earlier stages of\nthe operation by revealing inconsistencies.\n3.26.\nCoordination. Within the execution phase, coordination within the staff is critical to\nensuring activities occur as planned. This will ensure early detection of any failure\nto execute the plan as intended. Any changes to the operations deception plan\nduring the execution phase will also require close coordination within the staff.\n3.27.\nSynchronization. Tight control of the synchronization of events is required to allow\nevents to unfold at a pace that allows the adversary to build up the desired picture.\nThis will ensure events unfold as would be expected from the adversarial\nperspective. Deception staff must ensure they are aware of any failure of execution\nin accordance with the plan, to evaluate the requirement for corrective action. This\nrequires agreement within the staffs. An inherent danger of deception is the risk of\ndeceiving or confusing friendly forces, so personnel or commanders should be\nbriefed thoroughly, but on strict need-to-know basis.\n3.28.\nMonitoring. J2 should focus on the measure of effectiveness (MOE) included in the\ndeception plan, to determine whether an adversary is responding in the manner\nintended. If there are no identifiable activities indicating the required behaviour, the\nintelligence section should be asked to identify the reasons. While the deception\nmay have implanted the desired impression in the adversarial intelligence\norganization, it may be that the commander is unwilling or unable to react to it in the\ndesired way. Any intelligence effort to monitor deception MOE should not in itself\ncompromise the deception by paying undue attention to a particular part of the\noperation. There is a need to continually monitor the methods used to communicate\nthe deception story to ascertain the need for modification. This will involve close\ncoordination with J2. Through monitoring, it can be decided when the deception\nplan should be terminated.\n3.29.\nModifying the deception. There are circumstances under which modifications to\nthe deception plan will be appropriate but where termination is not yet required. It\nmay then be necessary to reduce the flow of indicators, increase the flow of\nindicators, or change the indicators themselves. Such circumstances may include\nwhen: the adversary has suspicions about the indicators fed to them; counter-\ndeception has been identified: events have caused the indicators to have been\nmissed; or the way the adversary receives information is not as first predicted. The\ndeception may also need to be modified due to operations failure such as: the wrong\ntarget has been chosen for the deception; the adversary collection assets are more\nlimited than thought and cannot verify the deception; or that the story is not\nbelievable or consistent."

Data collection articulates the\nprocedure for collecting indicators and their time-sensitive monitoring, as they\nrelate to the measurable behavioural outcome. Collect the evidence used to\nunderpin the assessment from a variety of sources. This is the mixed methods\napproach, collecting both qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data\n(i.e., what people do) provides numbers and allows analysis of data across\ntime (also known as trend analyses). Qualitative data (i.e., what people say)\nprovides an understanding of the context and meaning that underpins the\nquantitative data.\nc.\nStage 3 – Data collection and treatment. The collection and treatment of\nevidence should be conducted continuously during the execution phase of the\noperation. To achieve this, it is necessary to establish a baseline of evidence\nprior to the execution phase beginning.\n(1)\nEstablish a baseline before the operation. All assessments require\nan evidential baseline; a pre-operation baseline to gauge progress\nduring the operation against eventual outcomes post-operation. If the\ndeception plan does not establish a baseline, the staff will not be able\nto establish what has changed as part of the deception plan, or\nunderstand eventual success or failure.\n28 AJP-3, Allied Joint Doctrine for the Conduct of Operations."

Modern science has\nhelped to develop the discipline of cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology\nhas identified how the human brain is prone to systematic errors and biases.\nHumans are no longer viewed as \"rational actors' that methodically process\ninformation devoid of impulse and emotion. Specific areas of the brain do not\nprocess information in a sequential manner for specific functions, but rather,\nmultiple regions of the brain are involved in simultaneous processing across\ndifferent functions. The brain is an economical and efficient organ designed to get\nthe job done, as opposed to an organ optimized to do the job perfectly. Therefore,\nsuccessful deception exploits how the brain processes information.\nSocial influences on cognition and decision-making\n3A.4.\nCognitive processes occur inside people's heads but also between people in teams\nand social groups. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the social factors that\ninfluence sense-making and decision-making involved in OPSEC, deception and\ncounter-deception. The inclusion of social factors within human cognition is known\nas social cognition, or the socio-cognitive approach. Findings from social\npsychology are useful in understanding how social factors can influence group\nbehaviour and task performance because this underpins sense-making and\ndecision-making. This is important because the eventual outcome of any deception\nplan is to influence adversarial decision-making. Some of the theories and concepts\nwithin social psychology that have been found to influence decision-making include\ngroupthink, group polarization, minority influence, group cohesiveness, conformity\nand obedience. As with the cognitive perspective, these social concepts hold\nopportunities and challenges for creating behavioural outcomes in terms of OPSEC,\ndeception and counter-deception.\nHistorical example – Yom Kippur War\nThe following example illustrates how cognitive and social factors can influence\nsense-making and decision-making in order to deceive. On the 6th October 1973,\nEgyptian forces executed a successful surprise attack on Israel by crossing the\nSuez Canal at the start of the Yom Kippur War. Israel underestimated the\nEgyptians by holding preconceived, and socially-agreed, beliefs and attitudes\nthat Arab Forces generally lacked effective unity, as well as poor command and\ncontrol – this is what Israel's politicians and military commanders were willing to\naccept. The Egyptians deliberately reinforced these perceptions at the\nstrategic level through diplomatic channels, which appeared to point at policy\ndisagreements with neighbouring Arab countries. At the operational level, the\nEgyptians repeatedly mobilized and demobilized their forces, establishing a\npattern of activity. The Egyptians staged numerous deployments into the area\nby deploying large quantities of men and equipment, as well as constructing tank\nramparts and practising river crossings, thereby creating both illusions and\ndistractions. Egypt also stood down some 20,000 troops prior to offensive\naction."

The repeated Egyptian behaviour, which was credible, consistent and\nverifiable, conditioned Israel's perceptions and their expectations, which\ninfluenced their sense-making and decision-making. Eventually, Israel's\nbehaviour was one of inaction, mostly ceasing to react to the Egyptian\nmovements and not fully mobilizing in response. The result was that on the 6th\nOctober 1973 Egyptian forces executed a successful surprise incursion across\nthe Suez Canal by doing precisely what they had practised, but not concluded, on\nthe many previous occasions.\nParadoxically, this example also demonstrates the importance of knowing one's\nadversary. Ultimately, Israel was able to mount a successful counterattack\nbecause Egypt failed to assess the consequences of launching their attack over\nthe Jewish religious holiday of Yom Kippur; during the holiday, most Israeli\nreservists were at home and therefore, easy to contact.

Deception must be:\n\uF0B7\ncredible in their minds – is it believable;\n\uF0B7\nconsistent with the narrative of the operation and the strategic\ncommunications framework – does it make sense in context with what is\nhappening;\n\uF0B7\nverifiable by their collection assets in the time required – can it be\nsatisfactorily confirmed;\n\uF0B7\nverifiable by friendly forces collection assets – can we confirm the adversarial\nreaction; and\n\uF0B7\nexecutable in terms of the actions required over the time period available to\ndo so – can we actually do this in a timely manner.\n1.25.\nMultiple approaches. Creating effects through joint action (the combined\napplication of the joint functions of manoeuvre, fires, information and civil-military\ncooperation) will ensure an integrated approach. The greater the number of\nchannels used, the greater the likelihood of the deception being perceived as\ncredible.\n1.26.\nConceal the real and reveal the false.

Counter-deception is a staff function that seeks to identify and counter\nadversarial deception aimed at undermining the will, understanding and\nemployment of friendly forces. It is not the role of the deception staff to perform\ncounter-deception, but rather the responsibility of the chief of the intelligence staff\nto detect adversarial deception and the responsibility of the chief of the operations\nstaff to coordinate the appropriate response. Given their subject matter expertise,\nin practice it is likely that deception staff can support the intelligence and operations\nstaff. It is important that the deception staff do not assume responsibility for counter-\ndeception, as this could confuse and undermine their own deception work.\n1.34.\nExpect to be deceived. Just as friendly forces should routinely employ deceptive\ntechniques to undermine adversaries, so the commander should expect\nadversaries to attempt to do the same to friendly forces. It is thus imperative that\nthe staff remain alert to the possibility of potential adversarial deception and\nunderstand adversarial tactics, techniques and procedures and the wider political\nand cultural context in which their approach to deception sits. Consequently, it is\nnatural that the task to detect adversarial deception sits with the intelligence staff as\npart of the intelligence support to operations.\n1.35.\nActive counter-deception. Active counter-deception comprises the activities\nrequired by the commander once intelligence confirms that adversarial deception is\nunderway against friendly forces. The commander will seek to ensure their own\nEEFI remain protected and may task additional joint intelligence and collection\ncapabilities to reveal the true dispositions and intentions of adversarial forces. The\ncommander will then require a series of actions and managed information releases,\nplanned to cause adversaries to continue expending time, effort and resources to\nreinforce a deception plan that they believe is working. This is not as simple as\ntelling the adversary what they want to hear but involves a culturally sensitive and\nnuanced approach to information release and posture, presence and profile. Such\nactive counter-deception, led by the planning staff, will require careful coordination\nacross the headquarters and, in particular, with counter-intelligence efforts.\nSection 7 – Training\n1.36.\nTraining is not the focus of this publication but it is important that OPSEC and\ndeception training serves two purposes. First, it raises awareness of the\nrequirement for OPSEC and deception, stimulates the imagination and thought\nprocesses, and improves skills. Secondly, it raises the alertness of individuals to\ndetect actions conducted to breach OPSEC and to detect deception itself.\nCommanders and staff need to have the skills to identify EEFI, mitigate\nvulnerabilities, plan, execute and assess activities and detect counter-activity.\n1.37.\nIn training, avoid two particular pitfalls. Firstly, exercises should avoid overly\ncompressed timelines and rigid events lists, as OPSEC and deception plans require"

It details OPSEC and deception principles,\nroles, responsibilities and relationships with other staff functions in supporting the\noperation plan. OPSEC and deception are positioned as discrete information\nactivities that are not exclusively coordinated by information operations planners.\nCounter-deception is addressed, but this is a separate process and not the primary\nresponsibility of OPSEC or deception staffs.\nPurpose\n2.\nThe purpose of AJP-3.10.2 is to provide direction and guidance to NATO\ncommanders and their OPSEC and deception staff. It positions OPSEC and\ndeception as key activities that support the principles and operational\nconsiderations of joint operations and must be considered from the outset of the\noperations planning process. It emphasises the importance of these activities to\ncommanders and staffs.\nApplication\n3.\nNATO OPSEC and deception doctrine is primarily for use by NATO forces at the\noperational level but it is also a useful reference for all levels. It can also be a useful\nframework for operations conducted by a coalition of NATO partners, non-NATO\nnations and other organizations. It provides a common baseline for achieving\ninteroperability on operations, crises prevention and exercises."

The\ncommander should organize its staff, as deemed necessary to optimize its\nability to plan, conduct and support the operation successfully.\nPrincipal advisors\nA.2 The commander usually has three principal advisors: the chief of staff\n(COS), the political advisor (POLAD) and the legal advisor (LEGAD). Beside\nthese advisors the commander can add additional functional advisors if\nrequired, such as a tribal or cultural advisor. Grouping both military and civilian\nspecialists alongside or within the command group in a special advisory\ngroup is an established method. Furthermore, usually a deputy commander\nand deputy/assistant chiefs of staff are appointed, who also advise the\ncommander.\na. Chief of staff. The COS should be an experienced commander in\ntheir own right and, with the understanding they possess, coordinates\nthe work of the staff divisions by giving clear direction and setting\npriorities. They should also coordinate and fuse the work of the wider\nHQ including the joint force elements. It is their role to ensure the staff\npulls together as a team and has good esprit de corps.\nb. Political advisor. POLADs are civil servants or military personnel\nselected to advise the commander, but they rarely form a cell or branch\nwithin the joint force command (JFC) and JTF HQ. Principally they advise\non NATO policy; local, national, regional and international political issues;\nand political issues related to Allies, partners, non-NATO contributing\nnations (NNCN) and host nation (HN); and relationship with international\norganizations (IOs), non-governmental organizations (NGO), and other\nactors."

Within the joint force, exchange from liaison elements between\nthe functional components is critical to facilitate joint force coordination.\na. Differences in language, culture, equipment, capabilities, doctrine\nand procedures are some of the challenges that require close\ncooperation. The commander should identify additional requirements\nand request them at the earliest opportunity. The maximum use of\nliaison personnel, especially in operations involving NNCN that may\nemploy different doctrine or procedures, will enhance interoperability\nand contribute significantly to mission accomplishment.\nStrategic communication\nUK A.3 As described in Chapter 1, the UK refers to strategic\ncommunication rather than communications. At the national strategic level,\nstrategic communication is an approach for advancing national interests by\nusing all instruments of national power in a coordinated and synchronised\nmanner with the intent of achieving desired behaviours in target audiences.\nIt requires sufficient analysis of those audiences to understand how best to\ninfluence them. Defence strategic communication focuses on:\n- planning Defence activities with a concentration on what they\nwill communicate and to whom, instead of planning activities\nand then devising how to communicate them; and\n- ensuring consistency of action, images and words so that\nDefence's activities send consistent messages to the intended\ntarget audience.\nUK A.4 The perceptions of the outputs of our activities will vary\nfrom audience to audience and will only create the intended effects if\nwe sufficiently understand who the target audience is and how they\ncommunicate. A target audience analysis of the parties to a situation\nand an information environment analysis are essential if the appropriate\nactivities are to be identified, the intended effects created and the desired\noutcome achieved."

Establishing a liaison network throughout the joint force, indigenous\npopulation and non-military actors (such as major humanitarian\norganizations) will be a major supporting \"enabler'. During initial force\ngeneration planning, the appropriate operational requirement should be\nquantified in terms of quality personnel, communications and transport,\nand then included in initial force generation planning. The commander\nwill need to set policies and priorities to ensure a deliberate and\nstructured allocation takes place at the earliest opportunity and certainly\nbefore the arrival of the main body.\nc. Liaison officers generally represent the interests of the sending\ncommander to the receiving commander, but can greatly promote\nunderstanding of the commander's intent at both the sending and\nreceiving headquarters. They should have the authority to speak for their\ncommander and be of sufficient rank to influence the decision-making\nprocess at the level they are assigned.

They are a point of reference, as well as a\ndescription of the capabilities of the force. A number of subordinate tasks\nand related capabilities help define each of the joint functions and some\nof them could apply to more than one function. In any joint operation, the\ncommander joint task force (JTF) may choose from a wide variety of joint and\nservice specific capabilities and combine them in various ways to perform joint\nfunctions and accomplish the mission. The operation plan/order describes the\nway forces and assets are used together to perform joint functions and tasks.\nHowever, forces and assets are not characterized by the functions for which\nthe commander JTF is employing them. A single force or asset can perform\nmultiple functions simultaneously or sequentially while executing a single task.\nA number of related capabilities that apply to more than one function are listed\nin this Annex B.\nB.2 NATO integrated air and missile defence69. Integrated air and missile\ndefence is defined as all measures to contribute to deter any air and missile\nthreat or to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action to protect\npopulations, territory and forces against the full spectrum of air and missile\nthreats. The joint force air and missile defence commander is the commander\nwith overall responsibility for air and missile defence; normally, the component\ncommander with the preponderance of air and missile defence capability and\nthe command, control and communications capability to plan and execute\nintegrated air and missile defence operations. They integrate and coordinate\nthe air and missile defence assets of each force component into a coherent\njoint air defence plan.\nB.3 The joint force air and missile defence commander furthermore applies\nthe principles of air defence to counter hostile air activity, including theatre\nballistic missile defence (TBMD), and promulgates and employs common\nprocedures for air defence battle management and the reduction of mutual\ninterference, taking into account any air defence required and organized\n69\nSee AJP-3.3.1 Allied Joint Doctrine for Counter-Air Operations for detail."

As the responsibilities\nof the joint force air and missile defence commander and the joint force air\ncomponent commander are interrelated, they are normally assigned to one\nindividual. Generally the commander JTF delegates the air and missile defence\noperational level function to the joint force air component commander.\nB.4 Chemical, biological radiological and nuclear defence70. North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) forces must be prepared to conduct operations\ndespite the threatened or actual use of chemical, biological, radiological\nand nuclear (CBRN) substances. This includes threats from toxic industrial\nmaterials71. Any intentional use or accidental release of CBRN substances\ncan create effects that may disrupt or delay the achievement of objectives.\nThe commander JTF provides guidance to subordinate commanders on the\nbalance between operational priorities and avoidance of CBRN hazards both\nwithin the 'statement of intent' or “commander's intent” and as guidance in the\ncampaign plan. Policy application to minimize personnel exposure to CBRN\nhazards must be coordinated between national components, the host nation\nand other in-theatre agencies including, but not limited to, non-governmental\norganizations. It is the commanders' responsibility that plans take into account\nappropriate counter CBRN measures. Commanders at all levels must be\nprovided with timely, accurate and evaluated CBRN threat, hazard, vulnerability\nand risk assessments. It is essential that CBRN staff engage early in the\nplanning process and incorporate CBRN intelligence requirements into the\nintelligence collection plan.\n70 See AJP-3.8 Allied Joint Doctrine for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear\nDefence for detail.\n71 Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) is a generic term for toxic chemical, biological and\nradioactive substances in solid, liquid, aerosolized, or gaseous form created for industrial,\ncommercial, medical, or domestic purposes.\nUK air terms\nUK B.1 The UK considers NATO integrated air and missile defence to\nbe a standing Alliance mission rather than a doctrinal term. UK doctrine\ncontinues to use the traditional counter-air framework of 'offensive counter\nair' and 'defensive counter air', under the broader air power role of 'control\nof the air'. To better reflect the threat posed by ballistic missiles within the\ncontemporary operating environment, the term 'air and missile defence'\nmay also be used vice 'defensive counter air'.

MILENG\nas a function is coordinated by a military engineering staff. MILENG is an\ninherent aspect of each joint function; at all levels of command, in any mission,\ncampaign or operation, and in all phases. It achieves the desired objectives\nby enabling or preventing manoeuvre or mobility; developing, maintaining, and\nimproving infrastructure73. MILENG incorporates areas of expertise such as\nengineering, Explosives Ordnance Disposal, Environmental Protection, military\nsearch and management of infrastructure, including contracted civil\nengineering. MILENG also makes a significant contribution to Countering\nImprovised Explosive Devices (C-IED); protecting the force; and providing life\nsupport.\nB.7 Countering improvised explosive devices. The countering improvised\nexplosive devices (C-IED) approach74 provides commanders with the means to\ncounter the improvised explosive device (IED) threat by identifying and attacking\nIED networks, preparing friendly forces to operate in an IED environment,\nand mitigating or neutralizing the impact of IEDs. By utilizing this approach,\ncommanders will influence effects across all the joint functional areas. Effective\nC-IED will contribute to the Alliance freedom of action to conduct operations.\n72 See MC 0560/2 Military Committee Policy for Military Engineering and AJP-3.12 Allied\nJoint Doctrine for Military Engineering for detail.\n73 Infrastructure is a cross-cutting aspect of support to Logistics and/or Manoeuvre,\nperformed by MILENG. The interaction between this MILENG responsibility for infrastructure\nand the support to Logistics is expressed as “MILENG Support to Logistics” and also\ndescribed in the MC 319/3.\n74 See AJP-3.15 Allied Joint Doctrine for Countering Improvised Explosive Device for detail."

It requires the support\nand understanding of all those participating in operations as well as those\npreparing to deploy. The desired outcome of C-IED is to minimize the risks\nposed by an adversary's IED system so it is no longer a significant constraint\non the successful conduct of operations. C-IED activities are principally against\nadversaries (primarily their capabilities) and not only against IEDs themselves.\nC-IED treats the IED as a systemic problem and aims to defeat the IED system.\nTo mitigate and minimize the threat posed by IEDs, commanders and planning\nstaff must understand the adversary and the IED system. The C-IED approach\nmust be integrated into the planning and execution of activities at all levels.\nB.8 Logistics75. Nations and NATO have a collective responsibility for logistic\nsupport in operations. Responsibility for logistics reflects the fact that neither\nNATO nor a nation is capable of assuming complete responsibility for the\nlogistic support of a NATO-led operation. Logistics must provide the right\nsupport in the right quantity in the right place at the right time. This should\nencourage the cooperative provision and use of logistic capabilities and\nresources to support the force effectively and efficiently. Standardization,\ncooperation and multinationality in logistics build together the base for\nflexible and efficient use of logistic support. It is recognized that the ultimate\nresponsibility for support of national forces lies with the respective nations.\nB.9 The JTF headquarters role encompasses logistic planning and\ncoordination, prioritization and synchronization and promoting collective and\nmultinational solutions. The commander JTF will ensure that the logistic force\nstructure is capable of supporting the operation including reception, staging,\nonward movement and integration / disengagement and rearward movement,\nstaging and dispatch, and will coordinate support among contributing nations\nand the host nation to ensure operational success. To accomplish this, the\ncommander JTF should be given sufficient authority over the logistic resources\nnecessary to enable the commander JTF to deploy, employ and sustain the\nforces under command in the most effective manner.\nB.10 Medical76. Medical support encompasses the full range of medical\nplanning, preventive health advice and assessment, treatment and evacuation\nof the diseased and injured with the aim of minimising disease, injury and\ndeath and, returning to duty as many individuals as possible.

Medical capabilities\nand capacities should be proportionate to the JTF strength and operational\nrisks and will be influenced by factors such as the medical threats, operational\nlaydown and availability of and ability to fully utilize forward, tactical and\nstrategic evacuation. In addition, these and other factors will have a significant\ninfluence on medical evacuation and treatment timelines. Whilst NATO doctrine\nprovides guidance on timelines for evacuation and treatment, these timelines\nserve solely as useful planning guidelines for optimal medical outcomes.\nCOM JTF will ultimately determine the operational evacuation and treatment\nguidelines to be met given factors such as strategic direction and guidance\nand risk. Risk management should be conducted in consultation with the\nrelevant command and medical authorities.\nB.11 Military police. Military police (MP)77 are designated military forces\nresponsible and authorized for the control and maintenance of law and order\nand providing operational assistance through assigned doctrinal functions.\nThese functions may be: police, security, detention, mobility support and\nstability policing. As one of the combat support elements, MP support\nthe commander and the JTF with a wıde variety of missions, ranging from\npeacetime military engagement, securıty tasks in support of stabilization and\nreconstruction, up to combat operations.

MP perform similar functions in\nall components (maritime, land, air and SOF) which allows seamless transition\ninto joint and multinational operations. While component MP forces deployed\nin support of an operation may not be joint at their respective level, in order to\nachieve multinational unity of effort there must be a coordinating authority that\nsynchronizes MP activities to maximize interoperability.\nB.12 Stability policing78. Stability policing encompasses police-related\nactivities intended to reinforce or temporarily replace the indigenous police,\ncontributing to restoring and/or upholding public order and security, rule\nof law, and protection of human rights.

Battlespace consists of physical and non-physical environments, factors\nand conditions that must be understood to apply combat power, protect a\nforce or accomplish a mission successfully. It includes the land, maritime, air\nand space environments, terrestrial and space weather; information, including\ncyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum environments; North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) and non-NATO actors in the joint operations area\n(JOA) and other areas of interest.\nC.2. Battlespace management is the use of all necessary adaptive\nmeans and measures that enable the planned and dynamic coordination,\nsynchronization and prioritization of activities across all dimensions of an\nassigned area of operations within the battlespace. Battlespace management\napplies at all levels of operations and enables operational level activities\nin cooperation with relevant non-NATO actors. Effective battlespace\nmanagement will ensure the appropriate allocation of three-dimensional space\nand the electromagnetic spectrum, over time, to various competing users,\nto maximize coordinated and synchronous operational effectiveness, while\navoiding confusion leading to a risk to the mission and/or the force.\nC.3. Commanders must determine the degree to which battlespace\nmanagement is required. Force elements operating independently in separate\nareas may have little need to coordinate or syncronize their activities. However,\ncommanders who envisage high levels of interaction between force elements,\nworking in close proximity to one another, must coordinate or synchronize\ntheir activities and may require extensive enabling battlespace management\nmeasures.

Commanders should establish appropriate liaison elements to\nnon-military and/or non-governmental actors.\nC.33. Dependant upon the size and function of a headquarters on a specific\nmission, there are numerous options of how battlespace management\nfunctionality could be delivered.\na. Trust the process. The Commander may be unwilling or unable\nto allocate specific battlespace management resources (human and\nmaterial) to generate and activate a battlespace management cell.\nThe Commander would therefore rely on existing cross-functional\nprocedures to solve all battlespace management issues while\naccepting the high risk of battlespace management shortfalls that\nwould need to be addressed dynamically.\nb. Use of battlespace management structure. The commander\ngenerates and activates a specific battlespace management\ncell tailored to the mission and resources (human and material).\nManagement can be modelled in two different ways.\n(1) Centralized battlespace management. Battlespace\nmanagement is planned and conducted via specific battlespace\nmanagement meetings, working groups and boards led by the\nheadquarters within the existing battle rhythm, accepting the risk\nof redundance with other battle rhythm events but ensuring the\nmaximum coverage of battlespace management issues.\n(2) De-centralized battlespace management. Battlespace\nmanagement is planned and conducted through specific\nmeetings, boards and working groups when the situations\ndictates. Clear delegation and collaberative cross-functional\nbattlespace management understanding, planning, and execution\nare key requirements.\nC.34. If a battlespace management cell is established, its prioritized tasks\nshould include setting the initial conditions for use of the battlespace, without\nbeing overly prescriptive as to management. The battlespace management\ncell, in conjunction with components and sub-units, should fuse its detailed\nknowledge of environment-specific considerations and potential frictions and\nformulate generic battlespace management plans and procedures to suit\nthe operation.

A battlespace management cell is likely to be engaged continuously\nduring high-tempo operations. However, if initial battlespace management\nconditions endure and force capabilities and activities can be successfully\ncoordinated and synchronized using in-place measures, then battlespace\nmanagement may require little more than routine supervision. In practice the\ntiming and frequency of battlespace management activities should reflect\nchanges in the planning and/or operational tempo and be responsive to new\nor evolving operational risks.\nC.36. The composition of a battlespace management cell, although based\nupon a core membership structure, is likely to be adjusted and/or augmented\nto meet operational requirements and the chosen battlespace management\noption. All liaison officers or elements fullfil a significant role in identifying\nareas of potential inter-component / inter-agency friction and consequent\nrequirements for battlespace management. Operations across environmental\nboundaries, such as maritime, land and air operations, benefit from the\nexchange of liaison officers/elements co-opted to relevant joint task force\nheadquarters, component headquarters and other relevant actors.\nC.37. Liaison depends upon effective communication between co-located\nstaffs or via communication and information systems across separate\nheadquarters or other organizations. Robust voice communications and\nnetworked CIS that enable collaborative planning software, for example,\ngreatly assist near real-time battlespace management. In the case of the\nlatter, and providing that the network is protected against technical failure and\nadversary action and its reliability can be assured, then the demand on\ninter-component coordination and liaison may be greatly reduced.\nAuthorities, delegation and responsibilities\nC.38. Commanders are responsible for battlespace management within the\nJOA; however, they may delegate authority providing roles, responsibilities and\nlimitations are clearly articulated.\nC.39. To maximize combat effectiveness, battlespace management authority\nand function should be delegated to the lowest possible level. However, overall\nbattlespace management responsibility is retained at the delegating level,\ntherefore it is essential that the delegating authority maintains oversight."

Measuring success represents one of the challenges of battlespace\nmanagement. If an operation is successful, it could be suggested that\nbattlespace management proccesses and procedures have been effective.\nHowever, this fails to recognize the disproportionate effect that improvements\nto battlespace management can have on the planning and conduct of\noperations, and the rate at which the success is achieved.\nPhysical battlespace\nC.6. A single physical environment cannot be considered in isolation, as\naction in one environment may have battlespace implications for others.\na. Maritime. The maritime battlespace includes the sea surface of the\nEarth, any volume of airspace allocated above it, below the surface to\nthe sea floor, including any natural and constructed feature on or below\nthe sea surface.\nb. Land. The land battlespace includes the land surface of the Earth,\nnatural and constructed features, the underground areas below it, and\nany volume of airspace allocated above it.\nc.

Non-physical environments or domains pervade throughout, and\ninteract across the maritime, land, air and space environments, and are\nnot constrained by terrestrial or geographical borders. The non-physical\nenvironments cannot be considered in isolation, as action in one may have\nimplications across multiple physical or non-physical environments. Activities\nin these environments should therefore be coordinated within the information\nactivities coordination board.\na. Information. The information environment includes the information\nitself, the individuals and organizations, in addition to the cognitive,\nvirtual and physical space in which this occurs. The importance of\nworldwide distributed information, the speed at which information\nis communicated, the role of media and the reliability of information\nsystems have created a situation in which no Alliance decision or action\ncan be taken without considering its potential impact on the information\nenvironment. Managing information supports better decision-making.\nIn addition to managing friendly information, decision makers must be\naware of adversary influence operations and the actions necessary to\ncounter them.\nb. Electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic environment\ncovers a spectrum comprised of the orderly distribution of\nelectromagnetic waves according to their frequency or wavelength. The\nelectromagnetic spectrum pervades all other physical environments,\nproviding potential benefit (a significant source of intelligence, for\nexample) and potential vulnerability (in being comparatively easy to\ndisrupt or deny). Awareness of adversaries' and regional nations'\nelectromagnetic exploitation capabilities must be considered during\nplanning and factored into the emissions control policy to prevent\ninadvertent disclosure by friendly assets. The intensive use of electronic\nbased technology while managing the battlespace leads to a high\ndegree of vulnerability in context to the electromagnetic spectrum.\nc. Cyberspace. Cyberspace is the virtual, non-physical domain formed\nby all information technology systems interconnected on a global scale.\nCyberspace attacks are becoming more intense, complex and reflective\nof an increased level of sophistication. The risks and opportunities\noffered through offensive and defensive cyberspace activities make it an\nimportant element of the commander's battlespace management plan."

Time. While the environments comprise the places where military\nforces conduct their activities, time indicates when or for how long. Time\nis used as a tool to orchestrate activities in all environments, through\ncoordination and synchronization.\nBoundaries\nC.8. The commander will conduct operations within an assigned JOA. The\ncommander may receive guidance on any necessary conditions regarding\nmovement into and out of it, relationships with adjacent joint operations areas,\nand pertinent agreements with other actors. Component commanders are\nassigned an area of operations (AOO) and may receive guidance based on\npolitical, diplomatic and legal, physical and operational considerations. The\nmanagement of physical environments within the JOA is likely to be allocated to\nrespective component or delegated commanders.\nC.9. Boundaries define areas of operations between force elements, such as\nformations of units, vessels or aircraft. Assigned AOOs should not be larger than\nthat force element's area of influence. Additionally, AOOs should be exclusive\nand boundaries should not overlap. AOOs may be contiguous (where there is a\ncommon boundary) or non-contiguous (without a common boundary).\nC.10. AOOs may also be linear or non-linear. Many campaigns and operations\nwill present significant geographic challenges. Often, AOOs and adversary\nsituations will not allow for a linear and/or contiguous deployment. Therefore,\ncoordination, cooperation and mutual support between all actors may become\nincreasingly challenging.\nBoundary changes\nC.11. A permanent or temporary boundary change between components\nis the most common amendment to JOAs/AOOs and an important facet of\nbattlespace management. Such changes enhance agility and can improve\nfreedom of action. However, if changes are too frequent they can cause\nconfusion and increase the potential for friendly fire. Where boundary changes\nare required, the following considerations should be taken into account:\n- the impact on current and planned operations;\n- priority of use, in terms of where the main effort lies and the\ncapabilities of the forces and agencies involved;"

A seam is the physical environment where assets in one AOO interact\nwith, or impact assets or activities in another AOO. As the size and the\ngeographic diversity of the seam increases, operations are likely to get more\ncomplex and the requirements for cross-component dialogue and planning\nbecome more important.\nTechnology\nC.13. Technology can provide commanders with visibility over a defined\narea, and communications can enable them to command and control forces\nat range. Within a defined JOA/AOO, NATO forces may be required to operate\nat high tempo and with great agility. Multiple actors (military and non-military)\noperating in the same JOA/AOO present additional technological battlespace\nmanagement challenges.\nC.14. The implications of emerging technology for battlespace management\nvary from one functional area to another. Information management and\nfunctional area systems are key enablers for situational awareness and depend\non using technology effectively. NATO forces are increasingly, though not\nuniformly, network-enabled. These systems enable increasingly quick and\naccurate planning and provide control that is more dynamic. As battlespace\nmanagement becomes increasingly dependant on information technology,\nit is important that Alliance members and potential coalition partners remain\ninteroperable, otherwise the risk of losing the ability to share common\nsituational awareness increases.\nC.15. Commanders should guard against complete reliance on technology to\nunderpin battlespace management. Where possible, an independent back up\nsolution, capable of a minimum battlespace management function, should be\nmaintained. Battlespace management enabling networks should be designed\nto degrade with sufficient resilience to provide an opportunity to fallback on\nalternative systems, if available, in a controlled manner."

The exchange of tactical data via link has been a fundamental aspect\nof operations for many years, particularly in the maritime and air environments.\nTactical data link (TDL) information is a key enabler for aspects of battlespace\nmanagement at the operational level through its contribution to a common\noperational picture (COP). On multinational operations, however, individual\nnation security restrictions and other limitations of interoperability may restrict\naccess to services such as TDLs, C2 networks and near real-time intelligence\nbroadcasts, thereby degrading shared situational awareness (SA).\nElectromagnetic spectrum management\nC.18. To deliver an operational advantage, it is necessary to create the\nability to manoeuvre freely within the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) and\nhence manage the electromagnetic environment. This is accomplished by\nefficient and effective battlespace management processes that coordinate and\ndeconflict use of the EMS. Without effective battlespace management, it is\nlikely that emissions within the electromagnetic environment will interfere with\none other. Battlespace management also includes the practical coordination\nand, where necessary and possible, deconfliction of all EMS usage within the\noperational environment. EMS coordination and deconfliction plays an integral\npart of managing the overall operating environment.\nC.19. Comprehensive management of the EMS is critical to ensure the most\neffective use of limited frequency assets within a joint force and between\nadjacent and higher authorities. It enables military electronic systems to\nperform their functions within intended environments without causing or\nsuffering harmful interference. Such harmful interference may result in a loss\nof SA that, in turn, could severely hamper the ability to manoeuvre within the\noperating environment."

In the JOA, the concurrent use of the EMS by NATO and non-NATO\nactors implies that the EMS cannot be controlled by any one user. However,\nit can be managed to minimize conflict between users. Therefore, spectrum\nmanagers must exercise authority over all operational users to effectively\ncoordinate friendly use of the EMS, within constraints applied from non-military\nusage and spectrum availability.\nSituational awareness and combat identification\nC.21. SA enhances decision-making, enables effective management of the\noperating environment and enhances the overall effectiveness of the joint task\nforce (JTF). It supports the coordination and synchronization of military and\nnon-military actions against an adversary, and is a key component of force\nprotection.\nC.22. Combat identification is the means by which military units distinguish\nfriend from adversary during operations, with the aim of reducing friendly fire\nand increasing the operational effectiveness of forces and weapon systems.\nThis is achieved through the process of combining SA, positive identification\nand specific tactics, techniques and procedures. Combat identification\nimpacts on all aspects of a JTF across the JOA.\nC.23. Combat identification solutions which are designed to prevent friendly\nfire between force elements are often employed under national doctrine, and\ntherefore a degradation in SA may occur due to identification conflicts. This\nis particularly relevant when operating identification friend or foe and TDL\nequipment, and when forces operate under differing identification criteria.\nOperational commanders should consider the impact on operations from\nfailing to deconflict combat identification solutions when forming joint forces,\nand should test the outcome on COP compilation and risk of friendly fire.\nC.24. Battlespace management and combat identification are interrelated;\nboth enable increased operational effectiveness and the avoidance of friendly\nfire. Combat identification and SA are critical to effective command and\ncontrol. Combat identification contributes to SA and so enables more effective\nbattlespace management. Equally, battlespace management contributes to SA\nand thereby enhances combat identification."

Effective battlespace management requires an iterative battlespace\nmanagement planning process that begins at the outset of an operation,\ncontinues throughout the execution of an operation alongside the execution\nof the extant battlespace management plan, concluding only at the end of the\noperation.\nC.26. Battlespace management is an active process, as the continual\nevolution of the battlespace, including its shaping by other actor actions, will\ninfluence commander priorities and corresponding rules of engagement.\nCommanders require an effective method for proactive, as well as reactive\nbattlespace management.\nCommand and control\nC.27. Effective C2, is essential to the success of NATO joint operations. It\nrelies on cohesion and interoperability between all command levels. When two\nor more force elements operate in the same battlespace their activities should\nbe directed, coordinated, sequenced and deconflicted to enhance combat\neffectiveness. Where activities are concurrent and cannot be separated, they\nshould be subject to some form of control.\nC.28.

Battlespace management should be considered early in any planning,\nand appropriate battlespace management arrangements developed to suit\nthe situation. Battlespace management plans, which should be as simple\nas possible but retain a degree of flexibility, must be communicated clearly\nand agreed by all actors. Successful battlespace management planning is\nunderpinned by a presumption of free, rather than constrained, use of the\nbattlespace, unless and until coordination and control measures are deemed\nnecessary to facilitate interaction between force elements.\nC.31. Developing coordination and control measures relies upon consultation\nbetween commanders and planning staffs to preserve freedom of action and to\navoid unnecessary restrictions. Thorough analysis of the operating environment\nshould provide the Commander with an appreciation of the factors (specific\nto each dimension of the battlespace) that are likely to require battlespace\nmanagement measures. Subsequent battlespace management planning is\nbased upon the following (not exclusive):\n- centralized battlespace management planning and direction,\nemanating from centralized command and control formations but\ninvolving as many actors as necessary; and\n- specific delegations to appropriate commanders and other\nauthorities to manage particular aspects of the battlespace.\nStructures and relationships\nC.32. The battlespace management staff should comprise expertise across\nall staff functional areas, with battlespace management operating as part of\nthe headquarters battle rhythm. Battlespace management staffs should train\ntogether across all component, joint and coalition functions. They require\nexpertise and levels of collective performance to employ not only traditional\nprocess-driven methods of battlespace management, but also the increasingly\nimportant dynamic methods to facilitate synchronized and coordinated actions.\nWhile battlespace management and the battlespace are ostensibly military,\nconsideration should be given to extending its composition to include\nnon-military actors whose activities within the JOA may impact the force and/or"

Allied forces face internal and external factors and influences that\nmake it uncertain whether and when they will achieve their objectives. The\neffect this uncertainty has on their objectives is “risk”. The potential adverse\nconsequences of a risk are generally referred to as threats.\nRisk considerations\nD.2. Risk has different implications at different levels of operations.\na. Strategic level. Events that impact upon or change the overall\nstrategic context may have strategic implications, in the worst case\njeopardizing achieving strategic objectives or attaining the end state.\nStrategic risks are often associated with national standing, and the\nability to exert influence at home and abroad. There may, for example,\nbe an overly optimistic assessment of what the military instrument can\nachieve, undermining the credibility, and potentially even the feasibility,\nof (continuing) military intervention. Alternatively, any perceived lack of\nlegitimacy may undermine political and domestic resolve, and support\nfrom the international community, including any necessary approval\nor cooperation from an indigenous population. Amongst partners in a\ncoalition, any lack of cohesion – whether political or military – may also\ngive rise to the risk of discord and, potentially, to dysfunction.\nb. Operational level. Risk at the operational level is associated with\nthe relationship between strategic objectives and tactical activity. It\nmay manifest itself in several ways. First, the risk may arise due to an\nact of planning, such as selecting an incorrect operational centre of\ngravity or operational decisive condition. Misplanning of this sort may\nthreaten a commander's ability to achieve their objectives. Alternatively,\ncreating a particular decisive condition – even an initially ill-judged\none – may present an unexpected opportunity that can be turned to\na commander's advantage. Secondly, a commander's plan does not\nprevent risk arising during execution, either through external events or"

To aid subsequent risk\nmanagement, a commander may draw their own risk tolerance line,\nto provide broad guidance. The acceptable threshold may need to\nbe adjusted to the political situation or context. For example, in non-\ncombatant evacuation operations and similar operations, there may be\npolitical imperatives that require the risk to nations' citizens and forces\nto be reduced to a greater extent than might be necessary in combat\noperations. However, no matter what the nature of the operation, the\nthreshold should not be set to such a low risk extreme that the plan\nitself becomes risk averse. For example, casualties, deliberate or\naccidental, are a reality of operations and avoiding them completely\nmay well impact adversely on accomplishing the mission as well as\nbeing impractical.\nLikelihood\nVery high\nHigh\nMedium\nLow\nVery low\nVery high\nE\nE\nH\nM\nM\nHigh\nE\nH\nM\nM\nL\nMedium\nH\nM\nM\nL\nL\nLow\nM\nM\nL\nL\nL\nVery low\nM\nL\nL\nL\nL\nE\nH\nM\nL\nRisk tolerance line (example)\nExtremely high risk\nHigh risk\nModerate risk\nLow risk\nFigure D.2 – Example of a risk evaluation matrix\nb.

Selecting the most appropriate risk treatment option involves balancing\nthe effort and cost of implementation against the likely benefits, with regard to\nlegal, regulatory, and other requirements. A number of treatment options can\nbe considered and applied either individually or in combination.\nD.25. Risk treatment itself can introduce risks.

The consequences\nof operational risk may be that a commander's freedom of action\nis curtailed or an opportunity presents itself for exploitation. These\nconsequences may cause the JTF to pause, culminate or to increase\ntempo.\nc. Tactical level. Tactical risk arises from the results of both\nplanned activity and other anticipated events, and the unplanned\nand unforeseen. What is planned or foreseen may have intended and\nunintended (foreseen and unforeseen) results, which may be favourable\nor unfavourable. Favourable results represent opportunities to be seized.\nUnfavourable results, in turn, represent potential threats. Clearly some\nof these risks can be addressed through contingency planning, but it is\nthe responsiveness of the command and commander to recognize and\nact that reduces impact of those risks that are unforeseen, or arise from\nactivities or events that are themselves unforeseen.\nD.3. Linkage between levels of risk. In the same way that tactical events\ncan have strategic repercussions, and strategic decisions can have tactical\nimplications, so too, risks at the tactical level can have consequences at both\nthe operational and strategic levels. Commanders should always be aware of\nthis broader perspective when assessing likelihood, impact and ownership of\nrisk. It may be appropriate for commanders at all levels to compare their risk\nassessments to identify those risks that may migrate up and down the chain of\ncommand.\nD.4.

Military activity is inherently risky; taking calculated risks depends on\nrisk appetite and risk tolerance. While risk appetite and tolerance are closely\nrelated they are different concepts where risk appetite is linked to taking risks\nand risk tolerance is linked to controlling risks. Both should be established to\naid development of courses of action while balancing risks and objectives.\nD.6. Multinational operations. In multinational operations the difficulty\nof handling risks is compounded as a result of the number and range of\npotential variables. There are two common areas of risk often associated with\nmultinational operations.\na. Strategic cohesion. Some of the most significant risks a\ncommander may encounter are those associated with multinational\ncohesion at the strategic level. Just as determining a national strategic\naim and objectives are sometimes difficult to discern, establishing a\nmultinational aim and associated objectives can also prove challenging.\nUnless there is a clear collective purpose, such as provided by North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization Article 5, different national interests,\ndomestic politics (including changes of government) and interpretations\nof international propriety and obligation, are all likely to have an impact.\nIn such a strategic context, perhaps lacking an agreed strategy, a\ncommander must understand and account for national interests.\nb. Variance in risk appetite. Each nation determines how its personnel\nare employed, normally based upon their own acceptable levels of\nrisk. Moreover, as the threat is unlikely to be uniform across the joint\noperations area and may be subject to frequent change, risk treatment\nis unlikely to be the same across a JTF. Risk appetite will also change\nthroughout the life of an operation; it may be larger at the start and\nsmaller towards the end, and increasingly influenced by political factors\nas the operation progresses.\nD.7. Non-military actors. While nations' government departments,\ninternational organizations and other civilian partners work in highly hazardous\nsituations, they may withdraw their personnel if they judge that a lack of\nsecurity is preventing them from working effectively. Accordingly, and as\npart of the contribution to a comprehensive approach, a commander should\nconsider the risk appetite of non-military actors, determine their commitment"

Risk management creates added value. Risk management\ncontributes to the demonstrable achievement of objectives and\nimprovement of performance of the joint force.\nb. Risk management is an integral part of all joint force\nprocesses. Risk management is not a stand-alone activity that is\nseparate from the main activities and processes of the allied joint force.\nRisk management is part of the responsibilities of commanders and an\nintegral part of all staff processes, including planning.\nc. Risk management is part of decision making. Risk management\nhelps commanders make informed choices, prioritize actions and\ndistinguish among alternative courses of action.

Risk management is transparent and inclusive. Appropriate and\ntimely involvement of commanders at all levels of the allied joint force,\nensures that risk management remains relevant and up-to-date.\nj. Risk management is dynamic, iterative and responsive to\nchange. Risk management continually senses and responds to change.\nAs external and internal events occur, context and knowledge change,\nmonitoring and review of risks take place, new risks emerge, some\nchange, and others disappear.\nk. Risk management facilitates continual improvement of the\norganization. Commanders should develop and implement strategies to\nimprove their risk management maturity.\nFramework\nD.10. The success of risk management will depend on the effectiveness of\nthe framework that provides the foundations and processes to embed it in the\nallied joint force. The framework assists in managing risks through applying the\nrisk management process at varying levels and within specific contexts of the\nallied joint force. The framework ensures that information about risk derived\nfrom the risk management process is adequately reported and used as a basis\nfor decision making and accountability at all relevant levels. Figure D.1 shows\nthe necessary components of the framework for managing risk and the way in\nwhich they interrelate in an iterative manner.\na.

Establishing the context. By establishing the context, the allied joint\nforce articulates its objectives, defines the internal and external parameters to\nbe taken into account when managing risk, and sets the scope and risk criteria\nfor the remaining process. While many of these parameters are similar to those\nconsidered in designing the risk management framework, when establishing\nthe context for the risk management process, they need to be considered in\ngreater detail and particularly how they relate to the scope of the particular risk\nmanagement process.\nD.15. When defining risk criteria, factors to be considered should include the\nfollowing:\n- the nature and types of causes and consequences that can occur\nand how they will be measured;\n- how likelihood will be defined;\n- the timeframe(s) of the likelihood and/or consequence(s);\n- how the level of risk is to be determined;\n- the views of commanders and supporting actors;\n- the level at which risk becomes acceptable or tolerable; and\n- whether combinations of multiple risks should be taken into account\nand, if so, how and which combinations should be considered.\nD.16. Risk identification. Commanders and staff should identify sources of\nrisk, areas of impacts, events (including changes in circumstances) and their\ncauses and potential consequences. The aim of this step is to generate a\ncomprehensive list of risks based on those events that might create, enhance,\nprevent, degrade, accelerate or delay achieving objectives. It is important to\nidentify the risks associated with not pursuing an opportunity. Commanders\ncritical information requirements can aid the risk identification step.\nComprehensive identification is critical, because a risk that is not identified at\nthis stage will not be included in further analysis."

Risk analysis. Risk analysis develops an understanding of the risk.\nRisk analysis considers the causes and sources of risk, their consequences,\nand the likelihood that those consequences can occur. Factors that affect\nconsequences and likelihood should be identified. An event can have multiple\nconsequences and can affect multiple objectives. Existing controls and their\neffectiveness and efficiency should also be taken into account.\nD.18. The way in which consequences and likelihood are expressed and\nthe way in which they are combined to determine a level of risk should reflect\nthe type of risk, the information available and the purpose for which the risk\nassessment output is to be used. These should all be consistent with the risk\ncriteria. It is also important to consider the interdependence of different risks\nand their sources.\nD.19. Risk analyses can be undertaken with varying degrees of detail,\ndepending on the risk, the purpose of the analysis, and the information,\ndata and resources available. Analysis can be qualitative, semi-qualitative or\nquantitative, or a combination of these, depending on the circumstances.\nD.20. Risk evaluation. The purpose of risk evaluation is to assist in making\ndecisions, based on the outcomes of risk analysis, about which risks need\ntreatment and the priority for treatment implementation. Risk evaluation\ninvolves comparing the level of risk found during the analysis process with\nrisk criteria established when the context was considered. Based on this\ncomparison, the need for treatment can be determined. Decisions should take\naccount of the wider context of the risk and should be made in accordance\nwith legal, regulatory and other requirements. In some circumstances, the\nrisk evaluation can lead to a decision to undertake further analysis. The risk\nevaluation can also lead to a decision not to treat the risk in any way other\nthan maintaining existing controls. This decision will be influenced by the risk\nappetite and tolerance that have been established by JFC.\nD.21. Risk evaluation tools. Several tools are available to evaluate risk.\nExamples are the risk matrix, probability impact graph and a risk matrix which\ncombines threats and opportunities. The risk management framework can be\nused to standardize the use of risk evaluation tools.\na. Risk matrix. The risk of any particular event occurring may be\nplotted on a matrix, like the one shown in Figure D.2, showing the\nlikelihood of a threat occurring, versus its impact.

Frequently, lessons highlight strengths\nor weaknesses in preparation, design, and implementation that affect\nperformance, outcome, and impact.\nE.2. The idea of LL in an organization is that, through a formal approach\nto learning, individuals and the organization can reduce the risk of repeating\nmistakes and increase the chance that successes are recurring. In the military\ncontext, this means reduced operational risk, increased cost efficiency, and\nimproved operational effectiveness. LL describe more than just learning\nfrom experience, learning must be used to justify changes that will lead to\nimproved performance. The purpose of LL procedures is to learn efficiently\nfrom experience and to provide validated justifications for amending the\nexisting way of doing things, to improve performance, both during the course\nof an operation and for subsequent operations. This requires lessons to be\nmeaningful and for them to be brought to the attention of the appropriate\nauthority able and responsible for dealing with them. It also requires the chain\nof command to have a clear understanding of how to prioritize lessons and\nhow to staff them.\nE.3. Everyone within an organization needs to be involved in a LL process for\nit to be successful. A lesson is not learned until something changes in the way\nthe organization operates, and by those most affected by an issue. Operators\nare the most likely to identify potential lessons through direct observations\nsince they are closely involved with the issues. Unless these lessons are\nsubmitted via a LL process, they may not be discovered by lessons learned\nstaff officers and will not contribute to the learning process."

An effective LL process should be an instrumental part of any\norganization's overall improvement process. The establishment of a lessons\nlearned capability aims at enabling continuous improvement across the\nAlliance, thus enhancing the effectiveness of a joint force command or joint\ntask force. Quality control of the way military forces operate is difficult to\nachieve but one of the most reliable measures must be their performance on\noperations. Commanders must prioritize lessons, assign and track remedial\nactions, follow up to ensure their organization has actually learned and, just as\nimportant, be the driving force for sharing lessons.\nE.5. The commander is responsible for ensuring the force takes into account\nthe requirement to capture lessons learned during all stages of an operation\nand that an appropriate mechanism has been established from the beginning.\nAll units must be given clear direction on the capture, forwarding and storage\nof relevant data. The primary aim is to enhance joint force readiness and\neffectiveness by contributing to improvements in doctrine, organization,\ntraining, materiel, etc. Capturing and recording lessons needs to be done\nwhen the lessons are discovered. The more real-time the practice, the more\neffective it becomes. Waiting until the end of an operation to review lessons\nidentified may reduce their impact.\nE.6. During the operations assessment process, the assessment cell\nacquires a deep understanding of favorable and unfavorable actions during the\noperations execution. Generalizations can then feed into a lessons identified/\nlessons learned process. The operations assessment cell keeps record of all\noperations design related data, products and decisions during the operation to\nsupport post operation analysis. The data collected can help staffs understand\nthe operating environment and how military actions contributed to the success\nor failure of a mission. It preserves parts of the institutional memory that can\nbe used to learn from each other's experiences. It supports observations and\nanalysis leading to lessons learned and development of best practice.\nE.7. Identifying lessons for a multinational force requires careful consideration\nbecause some lessons will be a national responsibility and others will be\nfor the Alliance to address. Commanders at all levels must recognize this\nfrom the outset for subsequent analysis and critical review. Strategic plans\nshould include an LL annex providing operational commanders the necessary\ndirection, timings and guidance to address these issues. Operational plans\nshould also include similar LL guidance to the joint force. Likewise,\nlessons-learned databases are knowledge-based products that help users\navoid previous mistakes and adopt proven best practices. These databases\nexemplify how the marriying of information management and decision-support"

Figure E.1 illustrates a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) lessons\nlearned process82 which is comprised of several phases and stages. The\nfirst phase, analysis, begins with gathering observations. An individual within\nNATO makes an observation: \"a comment based on something someone has\nheard, seen or noticed that has been identified and documented as an issue\nfor improvement or a potential best practice.\" The commander of the given\nbody may provide guidance on the critical areas that need to be addressed\nfor improvement. The observer, supported by lessons learned staff officers\nand subject matter experts within the chain of command, then analyzes the\nobservation to identify its root cause. Once the root cause is understood, an\nappropriate remedial action that will address the root cause can be identified\nto correct the problem or sustain success. A remedial action is an activity or\nset of activities that corrects an issue identified for improvement or facilitates\nthe implementation of a best practice. Additionally, the person or organization\nwhich should execute the remedial action will be identified during the analysis\n82 For more information about lessons learned and the NATO lessons learned process,\nsee Bi-SC Command Directive 80-6 Lessons Learned, ACO Directive 80-1 Lessons\nLearned, and the NATO Lessons Learned Handbook.\nCommander's\nGuidance\nImproved\nCapabilities\nObservation\nAnalyses\nLesson Identiﬁed\nEndorsement\n& Tasking\nImplementation\n& Monitoring\nValidation\nLesson Learned\nDissemination\nSHARE\nAnalysis Phase\nRemedial Action Phase\nOBS\nLI\nLL"

Once a LI is\ndeveloped, the remedial action phase begins.\na. The first step in the remedial action phase of the NATO LL process\nis endorsement and tasking. During this step, developed LIs will be\npresented to the organization's leadership for them to determine how\nto progress the LI through the LL process. First, the LI will be endorsed\nwhereby it is approved for further action and the proposed remedial\naction is accepted or modified to be acceptable, and then an action\nbody will be formally tasked to plan and implement the remedial action.\nThe leadership also commits to providing the resources needed to\nimplement the remedial action.\nb. The next step is implementation and monitoring, during which the\naction body will prepare and implement their remedial action through the\nuse of an action plan and the lessons learned staff officers will support\nleadership in monitoring its implementation. After the remedial action has\nbeen implemented, some form of validation is needed, to verify whether\nthe original issue has been successfully solved. Verification may involve\nfurther work and analysis, possibly using exercises or experiments.\nc. Following the completion of the remedial action and successful\nvalidation, the LI will be deemed an LL and the formal LL process\nconcludes. However, it is important that further dissemination and\npublication of information occurs. Dissemination of the LL enables all\nparties to put the improvement into practice. As illustrated at the bottom\nof Figure E-1, information sharing takes place during the entire process.\nDefence lessons\nUK E.1.
